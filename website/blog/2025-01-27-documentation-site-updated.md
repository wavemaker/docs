How often do you visit the documentation site?

If you're someone who loves (or forced to) diving into the docs for answers, you’ve probably noticed a few things look… different. And if you haven’t been back in a while, no worries – this blog is here to catch you up on everything you’ve missed.
We’ve been working on docs behind the scenes, and now it’s time for you to explore what’s new.

*Spoiler: It’s not just a facelift; we’ve made changes to how you navigate, search, and interact (yet to come) with our content.*

## What’s New?

We’ve been listening to your suggestions, and your *"Oh, it would be so cool if this existed"* and guess what? We’ve acted on them! Here’s what’s happening:

### 🕵️‍♀️ Recently Visited Pages

Have you tried finding that one page you checked out last week but couldn’t remember where it was? Problem solved. When you reopen the Docs home page, you’ll now see your recently visited pages displayed as handy chips. Instant access, no digging required.

### 🔍 Search Recommendations

Search just got better! Before you even type a single letter, we’ve got recommendations ready for you. These static menu items are there to guide you toward what you might need before you even know you need it.

### 📖 More Room to Breathe

We get it—you’re here to focus. That’s why we’ve made it easier to expand or collapse both the left and right navigation menus, giving you more space to actually read the content.

> *Bonus: the right-nav is collapsed by default, so it’s clean and distraction-free from the get-go.*

### 🚀 Go to Academy

Learning while browsing? Yes, please! You can now jump directly to the Academy videos from the docs site-it’s all just a click away.

### 🎁 Feature Highlights

We’ve introduced a feature highlights section on the homepage. Think of it as a mini giftbox (similar to [Gift Box](/learn/blog/2024/11/04/introducing-the-gift-box)) of useful updates and interesting features. Stay in the know without having to dig around.

## What’s Next?

There’s more... we’re taking things up another notch with these upcoming features:

### 🤖 AI-Generated Related Questions

Ever feel like you’re asking the docs the wrong question? With AI stepping in, you’ll start seeing related questions pop up while you type. It’s like having a mind reader in your search bar.

### ✍️ Article Summaries

Pressed for time? Soon, you’ll get the TL;DR (Too Long; Didn't Read) version of a document right below its title. Quick, digestible, and straight to the point—just the way you like it.

### 🐶 Ask Pooch Button

Pooch, our friendly AI assistant, is ready to make your life easier. Soon, you’ll spot the Ask Pooch button right on the search bar. Need help? Just click it and start chatting.

### 🎥 Academy Videos in Chat

Here’s the ultimate multitasker’s dream: watching Academy videos directly in the chat window while browsing the docs. Learn and explore—all at the same time.

## Over to You!

We’re genuinely curious—which of these features are you most excited about? Or is there something else you’d love to see? Drop your thoughts to [documentation team here](https://github.com/wavemaker/docs/issues/new?title=&body=%0A%0A%5BEnter%20feedback%20here%5D%0A%0A%0A---%0A%23%23%23%23%20Document%20Details%0A*%20Document) and let’s make this the best documentation experience together.

See you in the docs (and maybe the Academy)! 🌟
