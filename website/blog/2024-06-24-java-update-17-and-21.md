This blog post provides an important update for developers about the end-of-life (EOL) for Java 11. 

Java 11, a widely used version of Java, is reaching the end of its life. This means that official support and updates for Java 11 will no longer be available. Without these updates, continuing to use Java 11 can leave your applications vulnerable to security risks and compatibility issues.

## Supported Versions and Important Dates

Starting from release 11.7.4, planned for July 1, 2024, Wavemaker (WM) will support Java 17 and Java 21. This upgrade ensures that your applications remain secure, performant, and compatible with the latest features.

## Risks of Continuing with Java 11

Persisting with Java 11 after EOL exposes your applications to:

- **Security Risks**: The absence of security patches makes applications vulnerable to exploits.  
- **Compatibility Issues**: Integration challenges may arise due to newer libraries and frameworks no longer supporting Java 11.  
- **Performance Degradation**: Performance may decline without the optimizations and improvements present in newer versions.

## What You Need to Do: Upgrade Your Deployment Container

To stay secure and up-to-date, you need to update the Java version within your deployment container to either Java 17 or Java 21. This upgrade ensures your applications continue to run smoothly and securely.

## Wavemaker Online Users

If you're using Wavemaker Online (WMO), you don't need to worry about immediate impacts. By default, WMO uses Java 11, so there will be no immediate disruptions for current users. However, the option to deploy applications using Java 17 or Java 21 is now available.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Is Upgrading to Java 17 or 21 Mandatory?**  
While not mandatory, upgrading allows you to benefit from the latest features and security enhancements.

**Why the Push for Java 17 and 21?**  
Java 11's EOL necessitates the switch. Java 17 and 21 represent the current LTS releases, offering better performance, security, and new features.

**Do I Need to Update My CI/CD Pipeline?**  
Yes, update the Java version in your deployment container to ensure applications run on supported versions.

## Summary

While upgrading to Java 17 or 21 isn't mandatory, it's a proactive step towards maintaining application security, performance, and compatibility. Updating the Java version in your deployment container is a simple process that safeguards your applications for the future.
