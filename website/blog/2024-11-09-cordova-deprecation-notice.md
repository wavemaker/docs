Over the years, our low-code platform has empowered developers to build hybrid mobile applications with ease using Cordova. Cordova played a significant role in enabling cross-platform compatibility and helped countless users achieve their mobile application goals. However, as technology evolves, so do the expectations for performance, user experience, and scalability in mobile development.

In recent years, we have transitioned our platform to focus on React Native as the standard for mobile application development.

## Transition to React Native

With this upgrade, we will be sunsetting Cordova-based app generation. This decision aligns with the industry's shift toward frameworks that deliver better performance and user experience for hybrid mobile applications.

As previously communicated in the below mentioned blog, we announced the deprecation of creating a new Cordova based application as part of the 11.6 release.

Initially, we planned to end the support for Cordova applications by June 2024, however, based on customers' request, we extended the support period until December 2024.

As we approach the end of this extended timeline, we would like to confirm that **support for Cordova applications will officially end on Dec 31st, 2024**.

## What does this mean?

This means we are fully discontinuing support for the Cordova project type. As a result, post January 1st, 

- Users cannot create new Cordova projects.
- Cordova projects will be **archived** and can only be **downloaded**.
- Users cannot **open** or **import** these projects.

## Looking Ahead

We’re excited to embark on this new chapter with React Native and are confident it will empower users to build even better mobile applications. This transition represents our commitment to innovation and providing tools that help users succeed in an ever-evolving tech landscape.
