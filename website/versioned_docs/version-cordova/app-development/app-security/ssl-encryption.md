A WaveMaker application can be accessed through _https_ protocol to ensure higher level of security in place.

If the user enables SSL, it means that the user will be redirected to the same URL but protected by SSL. For eg. if user inputs [www.wavemakeronline.com](http://www.wavemakeronline.com/), SSL filter will redirect the user to [https://www.wavemakeronline.com](https://www.wavemakeronline.com/) 

SSL Encryption can be set at the [**Profile Configuration**](/learn/app-development/deployment/configuration-profiles/) which can be accessed from the [Settings Secondary Action in Project Workspace](/learn/app-development/wavemaker-overview/product-walkthrough/#project-workspace). 

For Development Profile SSL Encryption is set by default. You can choose to change the setting for  Deployment Profile.
