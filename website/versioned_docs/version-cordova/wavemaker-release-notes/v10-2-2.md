*WaveMaker has released a new version with enhancements and bug fixes.*


## Fixes
---
- Variable API calls with the HTTP DELETE method accepts request body if passed. It did not work in [v10.2.1](/learn/wavemaker-release-notes/v10-2-1).
- For button group widget, focus state now works across all browsers, including Safari.
- Multiple issues fixed with Rich text editor related to HTML displayed in the editor, including inconsistency when using it in Live Form, and displaying `<b>` and `<p>` tags with the text. This is now fixed.  
- Default value of ```compression``` is changed to being ```true```. It was ```false``` before this version. This means that when WaveMaker apps are built, the static files such as javascript, css files will be compressed with gzip & brotli compression. If the WaveMaker app is deployed on your own Tomcat server, you will need to change server.xml in the Tomcat server to turn off compression by the web server. See [this page](/learn/how-tos/wavemaker-application-deployment-tomcat/) for instructions.
