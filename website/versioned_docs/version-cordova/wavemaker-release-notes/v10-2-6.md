*WaveMaker has released a new version with enhancements and bug fixes.* 

## Fixes

---

- Bug fixes on List widget with infinite scroll enabled when using a model variable.
- Styles for a popover widget added in a page were not working when added in page css instead of `app.css`. This is fixed.
- When clicking on a tab header, event was not propagating to the body. This caused any open popover widgets to remain open. Issue fixed. 
- For chips widget **displayexpression** property, functions defined on the page did not work. This is fixed now.
- For a chip widget bound to a model variable, search can now be done as case-sensitive and case-insensitive through method exposed on the widget.

### Mobile

- Bug fixes with sliding animation when using Accordion widget on a page.
