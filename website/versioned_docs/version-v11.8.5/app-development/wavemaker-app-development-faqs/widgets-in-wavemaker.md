Most of the HTML and JavaScript code required to build widgets such as Form, List, button, date etc. is generated by the platform. Each widget exposes dataset for “binding”, and this dataset can be bound to any backend services such as database entities, queries, external web services, custom backend services, and more, without having to write any code.
