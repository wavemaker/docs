It is observed that this type of layout is predominantly used in mobile apps. Instead of developer creating it everytime from the generic Layout widget, a simple drag and drop option will be helpful to developer.

:::warning
Layout and Flex Layout are available only for React Native apps. Cordova and Web apps will be supported in future.
