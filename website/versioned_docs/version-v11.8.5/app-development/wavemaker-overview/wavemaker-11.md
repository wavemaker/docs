## Migration to 11: what to expect

The upgrade is not flagged as a risky migration. The upgrade process is designed to transit as smoothly as possible, so you can instantly benefit from all the new features we deliver in the [newer versions](/learn/wavemaker-release-notes#wavemaker-online-v11x) of the WaveMaker 11 Studio. It includes new and advanced React Native features, Prefab Marketplace, Mockingbird support, inter and intra-team collaboration tools library updates, including a Java update, needing an action to do.

### Java Update

The Java 11 version is one update among the WaveMaker Studio's [latest tech stack](/learn/wavemaker-release-notes#technology-stack). A small action is required from your end to complete the update, specifically, if you build and deploy your apps outside WaveMaker. For example, Tomcat. 

You must upgrade your build infrastructure and verify the deployment setup to support Java 11. For this reason, we introduced [parallel versioning of Studio](/learn/app-development/wavemaker-overview/wavemaker-11-beta#multi-version-studio) so you can test your application thoroughly. Learn more about upgrading deployment infrastructure before initiating the project migration to WaveMaker 11 or later. See the [migration guide](/learn/how-tos/upgrade-guide-wavemaker-10-to-11) for more information.

## Angular 12

Angular 12 includes JQuery library upgrades as a standard. In addition, it offers performance improvements, language services, and more. 

:::note
Note that the Angular 12 update addresses vulnerabilities. Updating to the latest version of WaveMaker Studio helps keep your application secure against critical security threats.
