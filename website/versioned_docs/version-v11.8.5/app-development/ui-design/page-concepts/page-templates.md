Templates are editable pages with the layout and content defined. These can be used by the developer as a foundation on which the application pages can be built. 

## Default Page Templates

WaveMaker provides some default Templates for the ease of app development process. The templates are categorized under various heads like Travel, Sales, Healthcare, Finance, Human Resources etc.. Binding the various widgets on these templates to the various data sources will provide the required functionality. For Hybrid Mobile Apps these templates are categorized as a card, chart, dashboard, menu etc.

- Page Templates are available for _selection_ when adding a new page to an application.
- A _preview_ of each template can be seen by hovering over the template and clicking on the **Preview** button.
- For developer convenience, the Templates are _categorized_ as Travel, Basic, Sales, Healthcare, General, Finance, Human Resources, Social, Admin, and E-Commerce. For Hybrid Mobile Apps these templates are categorized as a card, chart, dashboard, menu etc.
- Each of the Templates has default values set, so the developer can get an idea of how the page would look like. Each of the content and widgets on the canvas _needs to be bound_ to live data for actual rendering of the page.
