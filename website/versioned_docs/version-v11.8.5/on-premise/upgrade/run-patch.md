## Running the Patch

- When upgrading from 10.7.x to 11.x.x user needs to download the required content for the migration process. **When the user has already upgraded to 11.x.x WME Version, in that case, there is no need to download migration tar**.

  - To download migration tar which will be shared by the WaveMaker team, please run the following command.

  ```bash
      wget <WME-Migration-Link>
  ```

  - Extract wme_migrations to /usr/local/content/wme/wme-installer/< version>/resources folder, for extract the content run the following command

  ```bash
      sudo tar xvf wme_migrations.tar -C /usr/local/content/wme/wme-installer/<version>/resources/
  ```

- In order to upgrade WME to **11.8.x** version from previous versions, it is mandatory to [Passivate Containers](https://docs.wavemaker.com/learn/on-premise/upgrade/passivate-containers) in StudioWorkspaceInstance and AppDeploymentInstance.

  - Run the below mentioned script to check all the containers are passivated or not on StudioWorkspaceInstance and AppDeploymentInstance.

  :::note
  The mentioned script is expected to run before the docker upgrade.
  :::
  
  ```shell
      bash /usr/local/content/wme/wme-installer/<version>/check_nonpassivate_ctnrs.sh
  ```

- Run the bash script for upgrading to the desired version.
```shell
    bash /usr/local/content/wme/wme-installer/<version>/wme-installer.sh
```

- To make https work, You need to add SSL certificates to Platform or router/dns level while configuring the setup using ConfigWizard after the Ugrade process completes in terminal, to add SSL certificates please refer [ssl configuration for platform](/learn/on-premise/configure/config-ssl).
