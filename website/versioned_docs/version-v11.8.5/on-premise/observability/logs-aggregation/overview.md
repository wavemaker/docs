Since WaveMaker is built on Java, we use *[Slf4j](http://www.slf4j.org/)* and *[log4j2](http://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/)* Java libraries to generate the required logs at the platform level.

All the logs generated by the microservices are aggregated by integrating the Elasticsearch Fluentd, and Kibana (EFK) Stack.

## EFK Stack

One of the most popular centralized logging solutions is the Elasticsearch, Fluentd, and Kibana (EFK) stack.

- **Elasticsearch**: This is is very efficient when it comes to dealing with huge volumes of data. We can easily filter the required Logs.  
- **Fluentd**: Collects the application logs, transforms them into the required format, and pushes the transformed data to *Elasticsearch*.
- **Kibana**: Since data can't be directly accessed from *Elasticsearch*, *Kibana* provides a powerful UI that helps in accessing or visualizing the logs.
  
> We will be focusing more on [*Kibana*](/learn/on-premise/observability/logs-aggregation/kibana) as *Elasticsearch* and *Fluentd* are only used as a part of the integration.  

## Architecture

The below image shows the architecture of the EFK stack

Here, The **microservice** containers labeled **A**-**Z** are spread across instances **10.0.0.1** - **10.0.0.N**

Every instance contains a "**fluentd**" container that collects logs from the microservices present in the same instance.

Then, *fluentd* transforms and pushes this data to the **Elasticsearch**

Finally, **Kibana** can directly access the logs as it is connected to *Elasticsearch*
