As an owner of the subscription, you can subscribe/unsubscribe or upgrade to a particular subscription plan. As a **Teams** admin, you can delegate ownership of the subscription to a different member.

:::note
WaveMaker support team members do not count as the number of developers allowed in the subscribed plan.
