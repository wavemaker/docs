**Teams** is a collaborative development environment on [WaveMakerOnline](https://www.wavemakeronline.com/).  
**Team Portal** is an admin console where you can manage projects, add or remove team members, manage roles, grant permissions, manage code repositories, and more. With Teams, you can choose to administer the organization data either by a single person, or have it managed by multiple administrators. To learn more about the subscription plans, see the [pricing table](https://www.wavemaker.com/pricing/ "WaveMaker Teams Pricing").

## Projects Collaboration Seamlessly

## Code Repository

Source code management is a critical part of the project lifecycle, allowing teams to manage their work with a single source of truth. **Teams** include support for integrating multiple source code repositories with the system so that you have access to source code and control over where your source code resides. It helps in setting up Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) pipelines.

Customize the access permissions for each role as you want. A user can perform actions on a project based on their assigned role & permissions.
