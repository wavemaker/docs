**Manage Roles** help you to define customized roles. Customize the access permissions for each role however you want. Therefore, the user can then perform actions on a project based on their assigned role and permissions.

:::tip
For example, you can create a role **UI Developer** to give fine-grained access privileges like create pages, change theme etc and assign those roles like **UI Developer** to the members of your projects.
Say, Tom is a UI developer. If you want to collaborate with Tom, you can readily invite him to work with you in the `Test-Sample` project with role **UI Developer**. Tom can then perform actions on a project based on assigned role and permissions.

:::important
**Project Roles** are different from **User Roles**. 

A User role defines the permissions of a user in the Team. For example, whether the user is authorized to access the Team portal or not. A user can be a **Teams** admin or a **Studio** user. 

Whereas, Project role defines the permissions of a project member in a particular project. A project member can perform actions on a project based on their assigned role and permissions. 

A project member's actions include view pages, edit pages, deploy application, and more. You can only create custom project roles.
