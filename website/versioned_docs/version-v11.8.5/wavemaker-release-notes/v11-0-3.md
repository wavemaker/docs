:::


## Bug Fixes
---

- Fixed an issue related to creating a branch project from an existing branch.
- Fixed an issue related to **Chips** widget to add new values in the chip list when **[Allow Only Select](/learn/app-development/widgets/form-widgets/chips/#features)** propertly is disabled. 

**Content Security Policy (CSP)**: 
- WaveMaker app now supports strict Content-Security-Policy. Keywords like 'unsafe-eval', 'unsafe-inline' are no more required in the policy, thus making WaveMaker apps more secure and less vulnerable to XSS attacks. Read how to configure the policy in your app [here](/learn/how-tos/configuring-content-security-policy).
