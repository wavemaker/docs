## Upgrades

<details> <summary>Upgrade to Java 17 or Java 21</summary>

With the deprecation of Java 11 Long Term Support (LTS), introducing support for compilation on Java 17 or Java 21 based on requirement. Previously with 11.7.4, applications could run on either Java 17 or Java 21 but could be compiled only on Java 11. This upgrade would allow users to compile the applications on 17 or 21. Refer to Java [Upgrade: 17 or 21](/learn/blog/2024/08/29/java-17-and-21-upgrade/).

</details>

<details> <summary>Javax to Jakarta Namespace</summary>

The transition from the Javax to Jakarta namespace is a major change in the Java ecosystem, affecting not only Java EE servers but also libraries like Spring and Hibernate. This shift requires all libraries in the Javax namespace to be renamed to Jakarta, requiring applications and dependencies to update accordingly.

**Impact on WaveMaker Apps**:

Currently, WaveMaker apps rely on Servlet 4, which uses the Javax namespace. Starting with WaveMaker's 11.9 release, these apps will be upgraded to Servlet 6 (Jakarta EE), making the switch from Javax to Jakarta. This change requires both applications and their dependencies to migrate. To understand more, see [From javax to jakarta namespace](/learn/blog/2024/09/24/javax-to-jakarta/).

</details>

<details> <summary>Servlet, Spring & 3rd Party Dependencies Upgrade</summary>

Along with the Java Servlet upgrade from 4.x to 6.x, we are upgrading our Spring framework from 5.x to 6.1.13 as Spring 5 has reached its end of life. With latest updates, Spring 6 is redesigned to support Jakarta EE. 

Additionally the third party libraries dependent on Javax might break and may need upgrade. To know more details about this upgrade, see [Upgrading to Spring 6](/learn/blog/2024/10/01/spring6-upgrade/).

</details>

<details><summary>Database Designer Upgrade</summary>

While importing a database, user can view the database table details like Primary, Foreign, and Unique identifier key information along with its connections with other database tables, in the **Design** tab. With this release, user can find some major enhancements listed below in the Design section.

- Now the user can select the database table to view the details instead of displaying the complete database structure.

- User can click the **Connector** icon to view all the incoming and outgoing connection details with other database tables.

![DB Designer Table Connector](/learn/assets/db-designer-table-connector.png)

- The database tables in the Design tab are available in read only mode.

- The number of Primary, Foreign, Unique identifier keys, and columns are displayed on top of each table.

These enhancements would make database search easy and clear with only the necessary information displayed on the screen.

</details>

<details><summary>Zoom Level Setting</summary>

Currently, Users can choose between two layouts of the canvas to view any application, Fit to screen and Laptop with MDPI Screen.

**Fit to Screen**: This option sets the entire application screen fits within the available display area without requiring any scrolling or resizing. It automatically adjusts the content to match the screen's resolution or aspect ratio for optimal visibility.

**Laptop with MDPI Screen**: This layout displays the application screen at MDPI resolution, which may be higher than user's current screen resolution, providing a more realistic view of the actual app resolution.

With the current feature, it was observed that the screen content were displayed diferently in canvas and preview modes, compromising the What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) principle.

Canvas:

Preview:

In this release, Zoom level is introduced that replaces these layout options. User can now set the Zoom level and maintain the same visibility in canvas and preview modes. By default the Zoom level is set to 85%. The maximum zoom-in and zoom-out levels are 120% and 50% respectively. To know more, see [Zoom Level Setting](/learn/blog/2024/10/11/introducing-zoom-level).

</details>

<details> <summary>Switching Java Version in Applications and Prefabs</summary>

Introduced a new field named **Java Version** in the Genaral setting screen. User can now switch the Java versions between 17 and 21 based on the requirement. This allows to choose the Java version for the development.

</details>

## Enhancements

<details> <summary>FileUpload Widget Enhancements</summary>

Introduced two new events in the FileUpload widget, On Delete and On Before Delete. These events provide greater control over the file deletion process, allowing for customization and confirmation prompts.

- **On Before Delete**: It triggers upon clicking the delete icon. This event allows to provide custom validation or checks before confirming.
- **On Delete**: It triggers when the user confirms the cancelation.

</details>

<details> <summary>WebSocket Integration</summary>

With this release, WebSocket integration has been re-introduced with enhanced UI. To understand how to import and integrate, see [Working with WebSockets](/learn/app-development/services/web-services/working-with-websockets/#importing-a-websocket-service).

</details>

## Bug Fixes

<details><summary>Row Selection in Data Table</summary>

In a Data Table, when Multiselect property or Radio Column property is enabled in Advanced Settings dialog, the rows get selected and the checkbox associated to the row gets selected upon clicking anywhere on the row. Added a new property in the Advanced Settings dialog, **Row Selectable**, to select the rows and check the associated boxes only when the edit option under actions column is clicked.

</details>
<details><summary> Nested Popover Issue </summary>

In case of Popover widget used inside another Popover widget, the outer Popover was getting automatically closed upon clicking anywhere within the inner Popover. This was observed when Auto Close property was selected as **Outside Click**. Fixed the issue where the outer Popover would close only upon clicking anywhere outside.

</details>

<details><summary>Retrieving Destination Page</summary>

Users can now retrieve the destination page value in the currently used page and directly navigate to the desired page. This is achieved by providing the destination page value as parameter to the **OnBeforePageLeave** event in the current page.

</details>

<details><summary>Binding option in Search and Caption Widgets</summary>

Previously, users were unable to customize the values in Datafield and Caption field in Search and Caption widgets respectively. With this fix, users can set the Locale message by binding the value to the fields.

</details>

<details><summary>Fixes in Chips and Data Table Widget</summary>

Added customisation in the Chips widget by allowing the users to add the message in the **Data Complete Message** field. Also added toaster messages in below listed dialogs in the Data Table widget.

- Delete Confirm Dialog
- Edit Confirm Dialog
- Add/Update Confirm Dialog

</details>

## React Native Fixes

<details><summary>Issue with Required Form Field</summary>

In Form widget, the required form field was not highlighted with red border and no validation messages were displayed upon submitting the required fields as empty.

</details>

<details><summary>Selected item in List is not Displayed</summary>

Earlier, users were unable to select any item in the list upon clicking the button. This button was used within the list. This issue was fixed and now the list item is selected upon clicking the button associated to that item.
