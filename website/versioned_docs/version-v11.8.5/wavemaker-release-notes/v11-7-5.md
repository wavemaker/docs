## Bug Fixes

### Studio Fixes

- Fixed an issue with the Menu widget where items were not rendering properly when the width was passed as a percentage.
- Fixed the Datatable issue that occurred when the multiselect property was enabled in the Advanced Settings dialog. Previously, items were not added to the selected items list if they were unchecked and then rechecked.
- Fixed an issue with the VCS view changes where the Compare File Diff dialog showed no recorded changes. This problem occurred when a user attempted to view changes in the API section after selecting REST API.

### iOS Fix

- Fixed the Select widget issue where the default value was missing when no placeholder and default value was provided.
