*WaveMaker released another version update with new features and bug fixes.*

## Improvements
---

### File Upload

- **Clear** and **Delete** methods are introduced to clear and delete uploaded files. For more information, see [Clear Uploaded Files from the UI](/learn/app-development/widgets/form-widgets/file-upload#clear-uploaded-files-from-ui).

### Textarea

- Introduced a new property called **Help text (character count)**, which shows when you set the **Maximum Characters** property of the [Textarea](/learn/app-development/widgets/form-widgets/textarea/) widget. You can choose a message from a provided formats list or create your own custom message, showing the number of allowed characters as you type. For more information, see the [Textarea widget Properties](/learn/app-development/widgets/form-widgets/textarea#properties).

### Datatable

Following issues have been fixed with the Datatable widget when pagination is infinite scroll or on-demand scroll:

- You can retain the selected row details, including edited values, when scrolling to the extreme bottom for viewing more records.
- The expended rows remain expended when more data is loaded by scrolling to the bottom of the table, and when clicking the **Load more** button.

### Tree Widget

- Fixed an issue related to the Tree widget's function when placed inside the container. The `selectById ()` function is working as expected. 
- Fixed an issue related to binding the Tree widget to a variable or a data node. 

### Other Bugs

- Fixed an issue related to REST API OAuth 2.0 pop-up, requesting to re-authenticate when on a new tab. 
- Fixed an issue related to the Autocomplete widget inside the Form, including the dropdown not showing in runtime when the web service with a Request body is bound to autocomplete widget.
