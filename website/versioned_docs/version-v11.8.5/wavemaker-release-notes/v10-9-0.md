### Upgrading to Angular 10

- With Angular ending support for Angular 9, we upgrade to the next Angular version, 10.2.5.
- This Angular update requires you to take action: 
    1. Update Node version to 12.22.3
    2. Update NPM version to 6.14.13

For more information, or help, read the blog [Announcement about Angular 10 Update](/learn/blog/2021/09/01/angular-10-update).

### Progressive Web Application (PWA) - Beta

WaveMaker web applications are responsive in general. You can convert a web application to a Progressive Web App (PWA) by enabling PWA, providing the native mobile app experience. 

Features supported by WaveMaker:

1. Add to the home screen
2. Offline capabilities - storing application code on mobile
3. Push notifications   

For more information, see [Enabling PWA - Beta](/learn/how-tos/building-pwa-app).

## Improvements

---

### Consistent Property Key Names in Profile Property and Service Property Files

Profile properties and service properties keys are now consistent. For property externalization (passing system env or system properties), the keys used to pass are now the same as the profile property.

Before this release, profile properties contained a service type prefix, whereas the service properties did not. 

:::note
Applications using property externalization are required to change the property keys. 

**For example:** 
Existing application: hrdb.url
Update to: db.hrdb.url
:::

### Reveal Hidden Widgets on a Page

- Show or hide all the hidden widgets on a page using a toggle button, located on the top menu. When you toggle to show hidden elements, all the hidden widgets in canvas show an overlay.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue related to autozoom selection in Google Maps of all types.
- Fixed an issue related to the Select widget when the boolean value of the Required validation is set to false. 
- Fixed an issue related to deploying an app with the Angular build, precisely when the app contains a Data Table widget, which shows a 403 error.
