<details><summary>Resetting Individual Form Field</summary>

Previously, users were able to reset all the fields in the Form with the reset button. Now, the users can also reset the invidual fields in the Form without having to disturb the other fields.

For example, the below code can be used in the Script to create a button to reset only the **CheckNumber** field in the Form.

```js
Page.Widgets.SearchForm.formWidgets['CheckNumber'].reset();
```

## Bug Fixes

<details><summary>Commit History is not Displayed</summary>

An issue was observed where the user was unable to view the commit history when more than 11 commits were made in any project. Now, user can click on button named Older to view the previous commits.

</details>
<details><summary>Datatable Grouping Issue </summary>

In Datatable, an issue was observed where the columns were misaligned when the columns were grouped and column names were bound to any Locale message.

</details>
<details><summary>Tooltip is not visible for Target Property</summary>

In Variable bind dialog, the Tooltip was not displayed for the `Target` property. This was fixed by checking the `title` property in the HTML code which is responsible for the Tooltip message display.

</details>
<details><summary>Bind Dialog in Prefab Configuration is Empty</summary>

An issue was observed when a user tried to create a UI property in a Prefab project. The Bind dialog was displayed empty when the bind icon was clicked in the Default Value field while creating a UI property in Prefab Configuration.

</details>
<details><summary>Conditional Class was not Applied</summary>

In Datatable, the Conditional classes were not applied to the first row when [Summary Row function](/learn/app-development/widgets/datalive/datatable/summary-row/) was enabled.

</details>
<details><summary>Search Functionality issue during Prefab Import</summary>

Users were unable to select any Prefabs listed under the Prefabs section, as it automatically selected the last Prefab in the list. This issue was observed and fixed in the Artifacts section when using any imported Prefab.

</details>

## React Native Fixes

<details><summary>Changing Donut Chart Center Label Programtically</summary>

Earlier, in Donut Chart, users were unable to update the Center Label colour dynamically. Center Label is used to describe either the values in each slice of the Donut chart or the title of the Chart. Now, the users can style the center label dynamically using the CSS variable on `.app-donut-chart-centerlabel` CSS class in Style tab and setting up a Theme variable in Script tab.

**Css Variable in Style:**

**Theme Variable in Script:**

</details>

<details><summary>Display Value Property in Number type Form Field</summary>

The value given in the Number widget is by default taken as Data value, which can be masked using Display value. Now, users can use `displayValue` property to add a Display value in the Form field of number type.

![Display Value in Form Number Field](/learn/assets/display-value-number-field.png)

</details>

<details><summary>Unable to Hide or Show Widgets</summary>

It was observed that user was unable to change the show property value in the script.Users can now use the `show` property in Script tab to hide or show a specific widget

</details>
<details><summary>Unable to Logout of application with OpenID Authentication</summary>

Previously, the user was unable to logout of the application when OpenID is applied as the aunthenticator and the CSRF was enabled in the security settings. The user was able to logout only when the CSRF was disabled. This issue was abserved because of the missing CSRF token in the logout API call.

</details>
<details><summary>orderBy Property is not working</summary>

In List widget, `orderBy` property is used to show the items in ascending or descending order. Previously, user was unable to sort the items using `orderBy` property which was now fixed.

</details>

<details><summary>Start and Stop Animation</summary>

To provide users the control to start and stop the animation in Carousel widget, two new methods have been added.

Use the below code in Script to create a button to start the animation.

```js
Page.onStartButtonTap() {
 Page.Widgets.carousel.startAnimation()
}
```

Use the below code in Script to create a button to stop the animation that is already in start state.

```js
Page.onStopButtonTap() {
 Page.Widgets.carousel.stopAnimation()
}
```

<details><summary>File Upload Restrictions</summary>

Earlier, users were able to upload files with any extension which can raise security vulnerabilities. To handle this issue, **Allowed File Extensions** option has been added in Properties panel to restrict the file extensions that are to be uploaded.
