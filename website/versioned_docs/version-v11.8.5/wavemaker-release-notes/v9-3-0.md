## Enhancements
---
### Mobile

- **Mobile Offline behavior** has been enhanced. ([#doc](/learn/hybrid-mobile/offline-data-support/#enabling)) Now you can:
    -   define the whether data needs to be bundled with the installer or will be synced on demand;
    -   specify the number of records to be fetched, the page size and apply filter criteria for the offline data;
    -   restrict the pull operation to include only modified records using the Delta Field configuration;
    -   enable import and export of offline databases using the [_exportDB_](/learn/hybrid-mobile/device-variables/#exportDB) and [_importDB_](/learn/hybrid-mobile/device-variables/#importDB) operations of the datasync service.
-   File Sharing setting is enabled by default thus enabling iOS users to access the app files from iTunes. ([#doc](/learn/hybrid-mobile/mobile-build-phonegap/#phonegap))

### X-Frame Options [#doc](/learn/app-development/deployment/configuration-profiles/#xframe)

-   X-Frame options for deployment and custom profiles can be **enabled** or **disabled** from the Configuration Profile dialog. Once enabled the **Policy Type** can be set to either "Same Origin", "Deny" or "Allow From" as before.
-   Comma-separated multiple URLs can be provided for "Allow From" Policy Type.
-   "Allow From" Header will automatically be converted to Content Security Policy header, based on the target browser, thus ensuring cross-browser support.

### Miscellaneous

-   Preview option now includes all iPhone devices such as iPhone7, iPhone7 Plus, iPhone8, iPhone8 Plus.
-   Toaster Notification Action now supports the content of a Partial page with Parameters. Values for these parameters can be set either at the time of Action creation or later from the Data tab of the Action.

## Bug Fixes 
---
-   Oracle memory leak issue related to OracleTimeoutPollingThread has been addressed.
-   Resolved the issue with Chips widget functionality in IE Browser.
-   Now, Esc key will trigger close function of any Dialog Widgets. This was not happening in the earlier version.
-   Fixed the issue wherein, the current timestamp was being sent to the timestamp field by default in a Data Table with a Live Form.
-   Default values that have been set at the database level were not being honored. This issue has been resolved with exception of data types biginteger, date, and datetime.
-   Relogin, after a session timeout, will now be directed to the page where the user was last working on.
