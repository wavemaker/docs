## Services

**Service** specifies the target service to be used. Each service is targeted to perform a set of operations for a feature. Available services are:

- **Calendar** – you can use this service to add, remove and list events in your phone calendar. The event details would include title, notes, location, start and end times.
- **Camera** – you can use this to capture an image or a video
- **Contacts** – you can use this variable to list the contacts on your phone. You can apply a filter on the list retrieved.
- **Datasync **- you can use this service to sync data
- **Device** – you can use this service to handle your mobile device features like vibrate, get connection type, model, OS, OS version etc.
- **File** – you can upload files to your mobile device
- **Scan** – can be used to access the barcode scanner.

## Operations

Based upon the service selected various operations are available.

### invoke(options)

This method invokes the device variable

**Parameters**:

- **options**(object)
- success (callback)
- error (callback)

**Return Value**: None

**Example**:

```
// Example 1: Notify with default set properties
Page.Variables.myDeviceVariable.invoke();

// Example 2: Notify with callback handlers
Page.Variables.myDeviceVariable.invoke(
    {},
    Function () {
       console.log('success');
     }, function () {
        console.log('error')
});
