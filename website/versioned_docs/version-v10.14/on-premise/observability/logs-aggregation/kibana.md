### Introduction

As WaveMaker is a distributed application, each microservice generates its logs in its own container. These logs are very important to analyze or fix any issue in the Platform.

Traditionally, you should to do the following to access the log statements.

- Obtain remote server access.
- Know the required details to connect to the server
- Access the container
- Open the application logs file using a *CLI text editor*
- Search for the required log statements using the basic string search provided by the *CLI text editor*.  

It gets more and more difficult if the logs are supposed to be shared with someone else or if you want to check the logs which have been generated a couple of days ago.

**Kibana** solves all these problems by making the logs easily accessible. One can also easily share the logs across the team with a single URL. The logs are also secure as they can only be accessed by authenticated users.

:::note
For more information, see [Kibana's Opensource repository](https://github.com/elastic/kibana).
:::

:::important
Kibana is purely used for the logs generated by the Platform. Application logs generated by the apps developed in WaveMaker are never pushed to Kibana.

## How to access Kibana

1) After the WaveMaker login, open the *Launchpad* and click the dial icon located on the top left as shown below.

2) In the dial menu, click the "**logs**" button as shown below.

**UseCaseOne**: Accessing Specific MicroService log( Developer-Cloud) from Kibana.

- Select Discover from the Kibana and add the Filter by selecting  **log_file_name** as edn-services.

**UseCaseTwo**: Accessing all Microservices log from the Kibana Dashboard.

- From the Kibana,Click on the Dashboard and Select **MicroServiceLogs** which is a Predefined Dashboard in Kibana .
- Below screenshot displays logs of all the available microservices.

## Kibana Filters

The required logs can be searched by applying appropriate filters. The below tables list out the most frequently used filters.  

Application log filters

| Filter      | Description | Example Value |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| `user.keyword` | Get the logs printed in the user context by using the user login ID  | `user1@my-wme.com` |
| `classname.keyword` | The log statements printed by a java class  | `o.s.w.c.RestTemplate` ( here, the fully qualified name is of the java class is ***o**rg.**s**pringframework.**w**eb.**c**lient.RestTemplate* ) |
| `host.keyword` | The local IP of the machine from which the logs are collected | `10.0.22.135` |
| `log-level.keyword` | The log level used for printing the log statement | `INFO`, `DEBUG`, `WARN`, `ERROR` |
| `message.keyword` | The actual log statement | can be any string  |
| `tag.keyword` | The Platform microservice name | `remote-studio`, `jobs-service` , `jobs-worker`, etc
| `thread.keyword` | The logs belonging to a particular java thread id  | `http-nio-8008-exec-3` |

Similarly, the *Access logs* are also pushed to *Elasticsearch*, they can be also be filtered using the below filters.

Access log filters

| Filter      | Description | Example Value |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| `reqmethod.keyword` | The request method of access logs | `GET`, `PUT`, etc. |
| `type.keyword` | HTTP request Type | `HTTP/1.1` |
| `uri.keyword` | The URI of the backend API call | `/index.html` |
| `url.keyword` | The URL of the backend API call | `https://www.my-wme.com/studio/` |
| `client_ip.keyword` | The IP of the client who made the API call | `127.127.127.127` |

*The `.keyword` suffix mentioned in all the above filters is optional. Adding it will just help in auto-suggestion.*

:::note
Apart from the filters mentioned above, Kibana supports many more filters, but the above should be more than sufficient in most cases.  
:::

## How to apply filters

Now that we know the filters which can be applied, let us check how to apply these filters in the below example.

:::tip
*Let's say we want to filter the **message** of the `INFO` log statements from all the log statements generated by the platform.*
:::

1) In the Kibana's Discover page, click the "**Add a filter**" button on the top left.

    [![Kibana Home Page](/learn/assets/wme-setup/wme-observability/kibana/kibana-add-filter-clicked.png)](/learn/assets/wme-setup/wme-observability/kibana/kibana-add-filter-clicked.png)

2) Use `log-level.keyword` as the filter type.

    [![Kibana Home Page](/learn/assets/wme-setup/wme-observability/kibana/kibana-filter-name-type.png)](/learn/assets/wme-setup/wme-observability/kibana/kibana-filter-name-type.png)

3) Select `is` as the operation.

    [![Kibana Home Page](/learn/assets/wme-setup/wme-observability/kibana/kibana-filter-operation-select.png)](/learn/assets/wme-setup/wme-observability/kibana/kibana-filter-operation-select.png)

4) Type `INFO` in the value field.

    [![Kibana Home Page](/learn/assets/wme-setup/wme-observability/kibana/kibana-filter-value.png)](/learn/assets/wme-setup/wme-observability/kibana/kibana-filter-value.png)

    That's all.

    But, as we want to check the *messages*, we can add that as a field by doing the following.

5) Click the "**add**" button beside the "**message**" label as shown in the below image.

    [![Kibana Home Page](/learn/assets/wme-setup/wme-observability/kibana/kibana-message-field-add.png)](/learn/assets/wme-setup/wme-observability/kibana/kibana-message-field-add.png)

6) Finally, this is what it should look like.

## Some Common Usecases

1) Accessing Specific MicroService logs from Kibana.

- Select Discover from the Kibana and add the Filter by selecting  **tag.keyword** , a drop down with the list of microservices is displayed, select the microservice ex:lbaccess log and save to apply the filter.

  [![Filter Icon](/learn/assets/wme-setup/wme-observability/kibana/micro-services.png)](/learn/assets/wme-setup/wme-observability/kibana/micro-services.png)

- Below screenshot displays the searched filter results of lbaccess log.
  [![Filter Icon](/learn/assets/wme-setup/wme-observability/kibana/lb-log.png)](/learn/assets/wme-setup/wme-observability/kibana/lb-log.png)

- Similarly Filter can be applied to other services like Login,EDN-Services,Developer-Cloud,Studio,Launchpad etc.

2) Fetching logs based on the Status Code.

- Select Discover from the Kibana and apply the Filter by selecting **status.keyword** , a drop down with the list of status codes displayed , select the status code and save to apply the filter.The below screenshot displays the searched filter results of status code 200.
