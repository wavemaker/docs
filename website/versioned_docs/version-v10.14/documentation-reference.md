Introduction to WaveMaker. Find a complete developer's guide to build an app with Low-code solution.

---
[WaveMaker](https://www.wavemaker.com/) is a low-code platform for developing a modern end-to-end application. It is a rich design studio with over [80 widgets](/learn/app-development/widgets/widget-library) that work out-of-the-box. In this section, you can find a complete developers' guide for building apps with RAD solution using WaveMaker Studio.

## WaveMaker App Development Flow 

**Step-1**: Create or import a backend service. It can be a data service, web service, java service, security service, or use a third party API.  

:::tip
WaveMaker provides a few ready-to-use sample databases and services. To learn more, see [Backend Services](/learn/app-development/services/creating-backend-services).
:::

**Step-2**: Design your app by simply dragging-and-dropping widgets on a page. 

:::tip
Widgets are UI elements, which make your app functional without coding. Explore the [widgets library](/learn/app-development/widgets/widget-library). 
:::

**Step-3**: In a few simple clicks, using [variables](/learn/app-development/variables/variables), integrate the backend service with the widgets. 

**Step-4**: Build your apps with the [one-click deployment](/learn/app-development/deployment/one-click-deployment/).
