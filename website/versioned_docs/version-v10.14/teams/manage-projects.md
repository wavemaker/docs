Sharing a project with a team member is so essential for collaborative work. **Teams** help you share projects and collaborate with other users in the team. The only users who will be allowed to access the project are the users you have invited to collaborate with. You can even choose to restrict what type of access other users have to specific projects.

**Manage Projects** allow you to have transparent project tracking across your team. This helps you to make sure each member is handling their tasks accordingly. It is a central place that you can leverage and access. **Project Admin** role has all the permissions for a particular project. Therefore, as an admin, you can override and assign or revoke the role from the project members.

:::tip
For example, Tom is a developer. If you want to collaborate with Tom, you can readily invite him to work with you in the `Test-Sample` project. If Tom is leaving the company, you can remove him from the projects he is associated with and invite new members to these projects with specific roles.

:::note
Members should be registered with **Teams** before they can be invited to a project.
