## New Features
---

### [Google Chrome Extension: WaveMaker Devtool](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wavemaker-devtool/niakeolhkmomhekokhdbfiaebkganjnk)

**WaveMaker Devtool** is a developer tool available as a Google Chrome extension, specifically developed to debug and monitor WaveMaker applications in preview mode. For more information, see [WaveMaker Devtool](/learn/app-development/dev-integration/chrome-developer-tool).

### SSL for Deployed Apps

Introducing SSL for Deployed Apps to [Demo Cloud](/learn/app-development/deployment/pipelines-phases#deployment-environment), allowing you to access apps with the secure protocol HTTPS. To support this, we made changes to the App URL pattern. Below are the changes.

**WMO Personal workspace**

Old: `http://p8888888n45.cloud.wavemakeronline.com/TestApp`  
New: `http://cloud.wavemakeronline.com/pk8888888n45/TestApp`  

:::note
In the URL, `pk8888888n45` is a Project key.
:::

**Teams and Enterprise**

Old: `http://wmshowcase.cloud.wavemakeronline.com/TestApp`  
New: `http://cloud.wavemakeronline.com/wmshowcase/TestApp`  

:::note
`wmshowcase` is the WaveMaker Online team's name and WaveMaker Enterprise's name in the URL.
:::

:::important
**Impact**: With this change, the existing app URLs do not work. Thus, the users can get updated URL from the Apps portal or deployed apps. You are required to update app URL in all the places where it is used for redirection. For example, when configured as OAuth redirect URL, or when used in other apps as API URL.
