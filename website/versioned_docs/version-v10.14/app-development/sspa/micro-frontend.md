[WaveMaker](https://www.wavemakeronline.com/) is a low-code platform enabling users to develop high-quality apps swiftly. Micro Frontends is a design practice that enables the users to scale their development and produce composable independent modules that can serve in building a new app or progressively integrate features into an existing app.

To support our customers' phased modernization methods, we wanted to build support for this cutting-edge design pattern in the microservices world.

WaveMaker is the only low code platform to support Micro Frontend modules extending low-code benefits to Micro Frontend development. It adopts the runtime integration approach for Micro Frontends and works with the **Single-spa** framework.

[Single-spa](https://single-spa.js.org/) is a JavaScript framework for frontend microservices, with support for multiple framework modules. Compatible artifacts must be generated and integrated for any app to work with **Single-spa**.

## WaveMaker Single SPA Framework

WaveMaker has developed a node-based CLI to generate **Single-spa** compatible artifacts for a WaveMaker app.

The CLI requires the exported project location, deployed URL as its input. The CLI and details are available in the below link.

## Generate Single-spa Artifact

Follow the steps below to generate the **Single-spa** artifacts for a WaveMaker application.

1. Ensure the node >v10.15 is installed on the machine.
2. Login to [**WaveMaker**](https://www.wavemakeronline.com/), Deploy the project, and note the deployed URL
3. Export the project from WaveMaker as a Zip, extract it into a folder, and note the location.

### Invoke CLI

1. Open the terminal and invoke CLI from the below command

```js
npx @wavemaker/wm-sspa-cli
```

- npx downloads the CLI and prompts for the location of the WaveMaker project and deployed URL.
- The usage of npx ensures the execution of the latest version of CLI.
- You can also provide the above info as parameters.

```js
 npx @wavemaker/wm-sspa-cli -p <project_path> -d <deployed-url>
```

- The CLI validates both the inputs before triggering the process.
- Once the valid params are provided, the CLI generates **Single-spa** compatible artifacts and presents users with its location.

### Generated Artifacts

The artifacts generated include:

- **main.[hash].js** : the application code and need to be used for app registration.
- **scripts.[hash].js**: the global scripts modules required for the WaveMaker app.

:::note
**Single-spa** needs the deployed location of all the artifacts, so ensure the files are hosted.
:::

1. Once the artifacts are generated, you can use the artifacts to register it as an application in the **Single-spa** shell.
2. Validate the changes using the [**Single-spa shell project**](https://github.com/joeldenning/coexisting-angular-microfrontends).

### Configure Script

1. Once the project is downloaded, open the `index.html` in the folder _[folder-location]/root-html-file_
2. Include the script below in the head section of the `index.html`.

```html
<!-- 
 Example: 
 [APP_DEPLOYED_URL]: http://localhost:8080/TestProject 
 [ARTIFACTS_DEPLOYED_URL]: http://localhost:8081/
-->
<script src="[APP_DEPLOYED_URL]/services/application/wmProperties.js"></script>
<script src="[ARTIFACTS_DEPLOYED_URL]/scripts.[HASH].js"></script>
```

3. Update one of the app target URLs in import maps as highlighted below in `index.html`.

```html
<script type="systemjs-importmap">
  {
    "imports": {
      "app1": "http://localhost:4201/main.js",
      "app2": "[ARTIFACTS_DEPLOYED_URL]/main.[HASH].js",
      "navbar": "http://localhost:4300/main.js",
      "single-spa": "https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/single-spa/4.3.5/system/single-spa.min.js"
    }
  }
</script>
```

4. Add a `.wm-app` class to the parent element of the route in `index.html`.

```html
<template id="single-spa-layout">
  <single-spa-router>
    ---
    <div className="wm-app">
      <route path="app2">
        <application name="app2"></application>
      </route>
    </div>

    ---
  </single-spa-router>
</template>
```

Once the changes are done in `index.html`, follow the instructions in the `README.md` of the [**Single-spa shell project link**](https://github.com/joeldenning/coexisting-angular-microfrontends) to start.
