## Prerequisites

- Access to Azure to create VM and other resources. For more details, see [Azure resource documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/overview).
- An Azure Virtual Network (VNet) represents your network in the cloud. We are assuming an Azure Virtual Network (VNet) is already built or existed. For the creation of a virtual network, see [Azure virtual network creation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/quick-create-portal).

## Creation of Network Security Groups

- For creating network security groups, see [Creating NSG in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/manage-network-security-group).
- For WME setup in Azure, it requires two security groups , including:
  - [WME-SG-Platform-Public-and-Internal](#creating-network-security-group-for-platform-virtual-machine)
  - [WME-SG-Workspace-Internal](#creation-of-network-security-group-for-external-virtual-machine)

### Creating network security group for platform virtual machine

- Provide necessary information, including name and region, by selecting the resource group.

- Provide tags that are name-value pairs for the network security group for categorizing the resources.

[![tags](/learn/assets/wme-setup/wme-setup-in-azure/nsg-platform-tags.png)](/learn/assets/wme-setup/wme-setup-in-azure/nsg-platform-tags.png)

- Create a network security group for a platform virtual machine with the provided information.

- After creating the network security group under settings, select inbound security rules, create a rule for developer network access and select protocol TCP and add a rule to a network security group.

[![ports public access](/learn/assets/wme-setup/wme-setup-in-azure/nsg-platform-for-public-access.png)](/learn/assets/wme-setup/wme-setup-in-azure/nsg-platform-for-public-access.png)

- If you want ssh access to only desired networks, create another rule and provide your network IPs for ssh access.

- Create another rule to open additional ports to access a Platform Virtual Machine from the Studio Workspace /App Deployment virtual machine. Next, select a destination.

- If you select the destination as a virtual network, the security rule is applied to Virtual Machines irrespective of the virtual network of the platform Virtual Machine. If you choose the destination as an application security group, it applies only to the VMs connected to that application security group. If you select the destination as IP Addresses, the rules apply to the respected IP address resources. For more information, see [Filter Network Traffic in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/tutorial-filter-network-traffic).

- Next, select protocol as TCP and select action allow. Provide priority is after the public access ports and select save and add the rule to the network security group.

### Creation of network security group for Workspace/AppDeployment virtual machine

- Provide necessary information, including name and region, by selecting the resource group.

[![basic](/learn/assets/wme-setup/wme-setup-in-azure/nsg-external-basic.png)](/learn/assets/wme-setup/wme-setup-in-azure/nsg-external-basic.png)

- Provide tags that are name-value pairs for the network security group for categorizing the resources.

[![tags](/learn/assets/wme-setup/wme-setup-in-azure/nsg-external-tags.png)](/learn/assets/wme-setup/wme-setup-in-azure/nsg-external-tags.png)

- Create a security rule to open additional ports for access from the Platform Virtual Machine. Select a destination.based on the destination it applies the rules to virtual machines.

- If you select the destination as a virtual network, the security rule is applied to Virtual Machines irrespective of the virtual network of the platform Virtual Machine. If you choose the destination as an application security group, it applies only to the VMs connected to that application security group. If you select the destination as IP Addresses, the rules apply to the respected IP address resources. For more information, see [Filter Network Traffic in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/tutorial-filter-network-traffic).

## Mounting Disks in Virtual Machines

### Mounting Disk in Platform Virtual Machines

- For ssh into the platform virtual machine, use the following command.
- If you are using the ssh key method for login, use the following command.

```bash
ssh -i /path/to/ssh-privatekey username@ipaddress
```

- If you are using the ssh username and password for login, use the following command.

```bash
ssh username@ipaddress
```

- Check your list of block devices available by using the following command.

```bash
lsblk
```

- New volumes are raw block devices, and you must create a file system on them before you can mount and use them. For creating file systems, use the following command.

```bash
Command : mkfs -t ext4 /dev/<block-device-name_1>
      mkfs -t ext4 /dev/<block-device-name_2>
Example :
      mkfs -t ext4 /dev/sdd
      mkfs -t ext4 /dev/sdc
```

- Use the `mkdir` command to create a mount point directory for the volume. The mount point is where the volume is located in the file system tree and where you read and write files after you mount the volume. For WME-Setup, create two directories using the following commands.

```bash
mkdir /wm-data /wm-runtime
```

- Use the following command to mount the volume at the directory.

```bash
Command :  
    mount /dev/<block-device-name_1>    /wm-data
    mount /dev/<block-device-name_2>    /wm-runtime  
Example :
    mount /dev/sdc    /wm-data
    mount /dev/sdd    /wm-runtime
```

[![volume mounting](/learn/assets/wme-setup/wme-setup-in-azure/platform-instance-mounting-volumes.png)](/learn/assets/wme-setup/wme-setup-in-azure/platform-instance-mounting-volumes.png)

- To mount an attached Azure Disks on every system reboot, add an entry for the device to the /etc/fstab file.
- Take UUID of disks for identification by using the command.

```bash
blkid
```

- To enter the UUID of the disks in fstab, use the following format.

```bash
UUID=your-block-device-UUID      /wm-data        ext4     defaults ,nofail  0  2
UUID=<block-device_1-UUID>       /wm-runtime     ext4     defaults ,nofail  0  2
```

### Mounting Disks in Studio Workspace Virtual Machine/App Deployment Virtual Machine

:::note
Applies for StudioWorkspace Virtual Machine/AppDeployment Virtual Machine.
:::

- For ssh into the platform virtual machine, use the following command.
- If you are using the ssh key method for login, use the following command.

```bash
ssh -i /path/to/ssh-privatekey username@ipaddress
```

- If you are using the ssh username and password for login, use the following command.

```bash
ssh username@ipaddress
```

- Check your list of block devices available by using the following command.

```bash
lsblk
```

- New volumes are raw block devices, and you must create a file system on them before you can mount and use them. For creating file systems, use the following command.

```bash
Command: mkfs -t ext4 /dev/< block-device-name >
Example: mkfs -t ext4 /dev/sdc
```

- Use the `mkdir` command to create a mount point directory for the volume. The mount point is where the volume is located in the file system tree and where you read and write files after you mount the volume. For WME-Setup, create two directories using the following commands.

```bash
mkdir /data
```

- Use the following command to mount the volume at the directory.

```bash
Command: mount /dev/block-device-name    /data
Example: mount /dev/sdc  /data  
```

[![volume mounting](/learn/assets/wme-setup/wme-setup-in-azure/vm-external-mounting-volumes.png)](/learn/assets/wme-setup/wme-setup-in-azure/vm-external-mounting-volumes.png)

- To mount an attached Azure Disks on every system reboot, add an entry for the device to the `/etc/fstab` file.
- Take UUID of disks for identification by using the command.

```bash
blkid
```

- To entery the UUID of the disks in fstab, use the following format.

```bash
UUID=your-block-device-UUID      /data     ext4     defaults ,nofail  0  2
```
