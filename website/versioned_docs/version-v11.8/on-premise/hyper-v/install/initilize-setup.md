## Setup Initialization Process

- WaveMaker platform requires a user; the user should have access to SSH to communicate between Platform, Studioworkspace, and AppDeployment instances, and for creating Docker containers.
- For WME setup, you can provide your own user with fine-grained access or WaveMaker will create a user called `wavemaker` with its auto-generated keys.
- If you want to provide your own user, create a user with specified [prerequisites](/learn/on-premise/prerequisites) and ensure that the user has SSH access.

### Running WME Installer

- After downloading and extracting the WME installer, run the bash script which is displayed at the terminal as shown in the command below.

```bash
    bash /usr/local/content/wme/wme-installer/<version>/wme-installer.sh 
```


- To configure SSL for platform please refer [ssl configuration for platform](/learn/on-premise/configure/config-ssl)

- When prompted, enter the interface name. For example, eth0, ens5; and confirm the IP Address.
- Provide the CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) range; CIDR is a network range allocation to a particular network address; it will tell you how many network IP addresses are available in a given network.

### WME Setup with Own User

For providing your own user in WME setup, follow the steps below:

- When prompted for **do you want to configure your own SSH keys**, select **`y`** and provide a username and a path to the SSH key.
- With this user and key, the platform can make SSH connection to StudioWorkspace Instance and AppDeployment Instance.

### WME Setup with WaveMaker User

For WaveMaker user, follow the steps below:

- When prompted for **do you want to configure your own SSH keys**, select the **`n`** option.
- Now the `wavemaker` user will use to communicate between the Platform, Studioworkspace, and AppDeployment Instances and for the container creation process.

- After successful initialization, the script will display a URL to perform the rest of the WME setup.
- Go to  <http://Platform-Instance-IP:8080> as directed by the above command output to do the WME setup.
