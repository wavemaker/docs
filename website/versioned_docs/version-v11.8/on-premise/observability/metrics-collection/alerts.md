The below link explains the configuration of alert notifications using various other channels like Slack ,Pageduty etc.https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/configuration/

### Configure Alert Notifications using Email Channel

1) SSH to Platform Instance and edit the file /wm-runtime/conf/alertmanager/config/config.yml by replacing the below place holders
   - ***@SMTP_HOST@ and @SMTP_PORT@*** with your Corporate SMTP Server Details.
   - ***@SMPT_FROM_EMAIL@ and @SMTP_EMAIL@*** with Corportate EmailAddress ex: notifications@xyz.com
   - ***@SMTP_PASSWORD@*** with valid password.
   - Change the Receivers EmailAddress  replace ***'devops-alerts@wavemaker.com'*** with your Corporate EmailAddress ex:devops@xyz.com
