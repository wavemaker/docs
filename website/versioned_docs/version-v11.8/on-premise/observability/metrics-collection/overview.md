*Metrics* is needed to get realtime application performance insights.

In WaveMaker platform, we have integrated the **Prometheus** monitoring tool. Prometheus is widely used and has a lot of opensource modules and tools which are
 easy to integrate.

The following tools are integrated with Prometheus in WaveMaker Platform

| tools      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| [cadvisor](https://github.com/google/cadvisor) | Collects *container* level resource utilization, performance and health related metrics  |  
| [node_exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter) | Collects *node* (Instance) level resource utilization, performance and health related metrics  |  
| [jmx_exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/jmx_exporter) | Collects *jvm* level classloader, thread, heap, GC related metrics  |
| [micrometer](https://github.com/micrometer-metrics/micrometer) | This is used to collect any custom metrics from the java web application deployed as a microservice in a container. |

With the help of the above tools, all the data is aggregated at Prometheus.

### Architecture

The below image shows how *Prometheus* is integrated with the components in the Platform.

Here, The **microservice** containers labeled **A**-**Z** are spread across instances **10.0.0.1** - **10.0.0.N**

**node_exporter**: All the instances *10.0.0.1* - *10.0.0.N* contain a *node_exporter* container which collects the node (Instance) related metrics  

**cadvisor**: Every instance contains a *cadvisor* container which collects the container metrics  related to all the other containers present in the same
 instance

**jmx_exporter, micrometer**: Every JVM application deployed as a microservice in containers *A*-*Z* generates its own metrics.
