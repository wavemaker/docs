## Configure form fields display options

You can set the following properties of the elements of the Live Form from the **Advanced Settings** properties:

1. set cascading data, i.e., restrict the display values for the current field based on the value of the field set against** Filter on Field** property. For example, the values displayed in the city field should depend upon the value selected for state field; then correspondingly for city field, filter on field property should be set to state.
2. specify the **widget** to be used to represent each data field. Based on the data type of the field, the available widget options would vary.
3. create **custom columns** by clicking on the **'+'** icon. **Note:** If a custom column is not selected for display, it will be deleted when the Form Designer is saved.
4. modify the behavior of **individual fields**, from the canvas, by selecting any field on the form and setting the properties:
    - The display **Title** for the field - can be bound to another variable,
    - **Input Type** to perform on screen validation of the user input, for example, setting the Input Text to email will ensure that the user enters the text in an email id format,
    - set the **Default Value** or bind it to a variable
    - choose when to **Update the data value** - on _blur_ or on _keypress_
    - set the **Update data value delay** in milliseconds
    - additional Validations like **Required**, pattern matching in the form of **Regular Expression** and **Maximum Characters** allowed
    - behavior like **Auto Focus**, **Read Only**, **Show** etc can be set;
    - **filter criteria** can be applied to referenced entities ([see here for usage](/learn/how-tos/using-filter-criteria-data-live-widgets/)).

## Live Form Validations

There are various ways in which Form fields can be validated depending upon the underlying data type. You can see these options in the properties panel for the selected field on the canvas.

1. For each field, check **Required** check box to make it as mandatory field while submitting the form, this will issue an error in case the user hits save without making an entry
2. For **Text Type fields**, **Regular expression** field can be used to provide valid and desired formats.
3. For **Text Type fields**, you can restrict the **Maximum characters** to be entered
4. For **Number Type fields**, **Minimum and Maximum Values** permissible can be set
5. For **Date Type fields**, **Min Date, Max Date, Exclude Days and Dates** can be set. In this case, the date picker will not have the invalid dates available for selection. [![](/learn/assets/LF_valid.png)](/learn/assets/LF_valid.png)
6. You can invoke the **hightlightInvalidFields** method on _Save_ action from the Advanced Settings, to highlight all invalid fields in red and display appropriate error messages. [![](/learn/assets/AS_actions_valid.png)](/learn/assets/AS_actions_valid.png)
7. For additional checks, you can use the **Before Service Call** event to perform any validation checks. For example, we want to make sure that the password entry is at least six characters in length. Select the **Events** panel and select Javascript for **Before Service Call** and enter the following code. This will ensure that before updating the data source, the JavaScript is executed.

```    
Page.liveform1Beforeservicecall = function($data, $event) {
        function isValidData($data) {
            /*restrict password to be minimum of 6 characters*/
            if ($data.password) {
                if ($data.password.length < 6) {
                    return {
                        'error': "Password too small"
                    };
                }
            } else {
                return {
                    'error': "Password field required"
                };
            }
        }
        return isValidData($data)
    };
```
    

## Using Widgets for Live Form Fields

Widgets like select, autocomplete, radioset, checkboxset and switch can be used for various fields within Live Form. These widgets can be used to show the predefined options to the user.

- When they are limited number of options: **Select**, **Radioset** and **Switch** widgets can be used,
- When number of options are more -  **autocomplete** widget can be used, as user can search from list of available options,
- When multiple options are to be selected - **Checkboxset** and **Select** (with multiple options) widgets are recommended.

1. Drag and drop a Live Form and bind it to a Database CRUD Variable.
2. Configure layout options, as per your needs.
3. In fields configuration step, change the required field widget type to Select. [![](/learn/assets/lf_widget_fields.png)](/learn/assets/lf_widget_fields.png)
4. Select the field from the canvas.
5. The dataset for the form field widget is auto populated with the Variable Dataset field. Data field and display field is set to field’s key. Here, the dataset value can be bound to any other variable or widget. [![](/learn/assets/lf_widget_propss.png)](/learn/assets/lf_widget_propss.png)
6. The widget can be changed from Live Form Advanced Settings also. [![](/learn/assets/lf_widget_AS.png)](/learn/assets/lf_widget_AS.png)
7. Now, at runtime, the user can use this widget to select a value from predefined options. [![](/learn/assets/lf_widget_run.png)](/learn/assets/lf_widget_run.png)
