## Events

Data Table behavior can be customized with the help of the call-back events. These events can be accessed from the events tab on the Properties panel. The trigger for the event can be JavaScript, another Variable call, and more.

| Event | Trigger and JavaScript Usage |
| --- | --- |
|**On Row Click** | This event will be called when a row in Data Table is clicked.   **Note**: This event can happen when selecting or deselecting a row. |

```js
Page.[DataTableName]Rowclick = function($event, widget, row) {
        //row has the data of the row which is clicked and the index of the row
        // Note: Row selection will happen on click of a cell. So, cell element is present in $event.

       //Printing the clicked row data and its index
        console.log(“The clicked row data with index:”, row.index , row); 
    };
```

| Event | Trigger and JavaScript Usage |
| --- | --- |
|**On Row Select**| This event will be called when a row from Data Table is selected |

```js
Page.[dataTableName]Select = function($event, widget, row) { 
        //row: row has the selected row data. row has also the index of the row
        // Note: Row selection will happen on click of a cell. So, cell element is present in $event.
        //Printing the selected row data and its index

        console.log(“The row data with index:”, row.index , row); 
    };
```

| Event | Trigger and JavaScript Usage |
| --- | --- |
|**On Row Deselect**| This event will be called when a row from Data Table is deselected. |

```js
Page.[dataTableName]Deselect = function($event, widget, row) {
        //row has the deselected row data. Row has also the index of the row.
        // Note: Row deselection will happen on click of a cell. So, cell element is present in $event.
        //Printing the deselected row data and its index
        console.log(“The row data with index:”, row.index , row);
    };
```

| Event | Trigger and JavaScript Usage |
| --- | --- |
|**On Data Sort**| This event will be called when the Data Table header is clicked to sort by a particular column. |

```js
Page.[dataTableName]Sort = function($event, widget, $data) {
        //$data: $data contains the newly sorted data, colDef, and sortDirection

        // Note: Column selection will happen on click of the header. So, column element is present in $event.
        //Printing the sorted data
        console.log(“The sort column data:”, $data);
    };
```

| Event | Trigger and JavaScript Usage |
| --- | --- |
| **On Header Click** | This event will be called when the Data Table header is clicked. |

```js
Page.[dataTableName]Headerclick = function($event, widget, column) {
        
        //column has the column definition data of the corresponding clicked header.
        // Note: Column selection will happen on click of the header. So, column element is present in $event.

        //Printing the selected column field and the column definition
        console.log(“The column data with column field:”, column.field , column); 
    };
```

| Event | Trigger and JavaScript Usage |

```js
Page.[dataTableName]Beforefilter = function($event, widget, columns) {
    // Add tenantId filter always

## Methods
---
Data Table has few methods exposed on widget scope which can be accessed via JavaScript. For the following script samples, we are considering the hrdb Department table. DepartmentGrid is bound to the Database CRUD Variable corresponding to the Department table.

- To refresh the data in data table with the currently applied filters and sort:

```js
Page.Widgets.[gridName].refreshData();
```

- To clear the filters applied on data table:

```js
Page.Widgets.[gridName].clearFilter();
```

- To focus on a field in edit mode(applicable to inline and quick edit data tables alone):

```js
Page.Widgets.[dataTableName].formfields.[columnname].focus();
//This will focus the input on [columnname] field
```

- To change a property of a column:

```js
Page.Widgets.[dataTableName].columns.[columnname].displayName = ‘Deptarment Id’;
//Will change the display name of specified column to ‘Department Id’.
```

- To force re-render Data Table:

```js
Page.Widgets.[dataTableName].redraw(true); 
//Will force re-render data table.
```

- To change a property of a column:

```js
    Page.Widgets.[dataTableName].column.[columnname].sortable = false; 
    // disables the sort property on the data table 
    //Note: you can replace 'sortable' with any column property listed in the advanced settings.
```

- To change value of a field which is in edit mode (applicable to inline and quick edit data tables alone):

```js
    Page.Widgets.[dataTableName].formfields.[columnname].widget.datavalue = 'Engineering 1'; 
    // Sets ‘Engineering 1’ to the specified column edit field 
    //Note: This will work only on click of edit on a row.
```

- To retrieve value of a field which is in edit mode (applicable to inline and quick edit data tables alone):

```js
    console.log(Page.Widgets.[dataTableName].formfields.[columnname].getProperty('value')); 
    // This will display the specified column field value in the console. 
    //Note: This will work only on click of edit on a row.
```

- To select a row:

```js
    Page.Widgets.[dataTableName].selectItem(1); 
    // The parameter can be index or object of row
```

- To deselect a row:

:::note
Deselect will work only for data table with multiselect enabled on it.
:::

```js
    Page.Widgets.[dataTableName].deselectItem(1);
    //the parameter can be index or object of row (data bound to row), 
    //For grid actions user can send $row (which is row data) , 
    //that can be sent as an argument to this method.
```

- Working with selected item:

```js
    Page.Widgets.[dataTableName].selecteditem = 2; 
    //Selects the third row or item          
    Page.Widgets.[dataTableName].selecteditem = [2, 3]; 
    //Selects the third and fourth row/item 
    Page.Widgets.[dataTableName].selecteditem = []; 
    //Deselects the existing rows or items
```

- Set filter mode:

```js
    Page.Widgets.[dataTableName].filtermode = ‘search’; 
    // To set filter mode as search
    Page.Widgets.[dataTableName].filtermode = ‘multicolumn’; 
    //To set filter mode as multi column
```
  
## Inline edit for service variable

Inline editing can be enabled for a Data Table when bound to a Web Service/Java Service Variable

- Go to Advanced Settings for the Data Table.
- Go to the Actions tab.
- Select the New, Edit and Delete actions.
- As the Data Table is bound to Variable based on APIs exposed by the web service/ java service which returns list of records, for edit, update or delete user should map it to respective variables. This can be achieved through events on data table.
- To _On Record Insert_:

```js
Page.[gridName]Rowinsert = function($event, widget, row) {
        //row: row has the data of the row being inserted
        //row can be modified here
        row.dateInserted = Date.now();
        //Set the input as row for variable
        Page.Variables.[insertVariable].setInput(row);
        //Insert the data by invoking the variable
        Page.Variables.[insertVariable].invoke({}, function() {
        //On success, call the refreshData on method to get the refreshed data
        widget.refreshData();
        });
    };
```

- To On Record Update:

```js
Page.[gridName]Rowupdate = function($event, widget, row) {
    //row: row has the data of the row being updated
    //row can be modified here
    row.dateModified = Date.now();
    //Set the input as row for variable
    Page.Variables.[updateVariable].setInput(row);
    //Update the data by invoking the variable
    Page.Variables.[updateVariable].invoke({}, function() {
        //On success, call the refreshData on method to get the refreshed data
        widget.refreshData();
        });
    };
```

- On Record Delete:

```js
Page.[gridName]Rowdelete = function($event, widget, row) {
        //row: row has the data of the row being deleted
        //Set the input as row for variable
        Page.Variables.[deleteVariable].setInput(row);
        //Delete the data by invoking the variable
        Page.Variables.[deleteVariable].invoke({}, function() {
            //On success, call the refreshData on method to get the refreshed data
            widget.refreshData();
        });
    };
```

Methods: Below methods can be used for inline editing (applicable to inline and quick edit data tables alone)

- To edit a row

```js
    Page.Widgets.[dataTableName].editRow(); 
    // Selected row will be edited
```

- To add a new row

```js
    Page.Widgets.[dataTableName].addRow();
```

- To save a row

```js
    Page.Widgets.[dataTableName].saveRow();
```

- To cancel a row edit

```js
    Page.Widgets.[dataTableName].cancelRow();
```

- To delete a row

```js
    Page.Widgets.[dataTableName].deleteRow();
```

- To hide the edit row and go back to view mode

```js
    Page.Widgets.[dataTableName].hideEditRow();
```
