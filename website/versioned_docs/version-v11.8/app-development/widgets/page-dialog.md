## Overview

Dragging and dropping a dialog creates a **view** containing the dialog. The view can be selected from the **Page Structure** or from the **tabs** given at the bottom. The display of the dialog box at runtime is usually associated with the _onClick_ event of a **Button** widget. You can also trigger the dialog by calling methods from _JavaScript_.

## Page Dialog

Page Dialog is a popup window that displays page content and can be dismissed by the user. The **content** property of this widget can be set to the desired [partial page](/learn/app-development/ui-design/page-concepts/partial-pages/) content.

## Script Access

**Dialog** widget in your project can be accessed by associating the open and _close_ properties of the dialog with an event of any other widget. The dialog can be accessed through scripting by adding _DialogService_ to the _page controller_ and adding the code for _open_ and _close_ as shown below, here we are displaying an alert dialog on click of a button: Click event of the button should trigger the following JavaScript code:

```js  
Page.button3Click = function($event, widget) {
     Page.Widgets.pagedialog1.open();
 }
```

For hiding dialog:

```js
/* function called on button1 click */
        Page.button1Click = function($event, widget) {
            Page.Widgets.pagedialog1.close();
        };
```
