## Overview 
Dragging and dropping a dialog creates a **view** containing the dialog. The view can be selected from the **Page Structure** or from the **tabs** given at the bottom. The display of the dialog box at runtime is usually associated with the _onClick_ event of a **Button** widget. You can also trigger the dialog by calling methods from _JavaScript_.

## Alert Dialog

For **Alert Dialog**, you can set:

- the name, the title of the alert pop-up, message to be displayed in the pop-up, text on the OK button and the type of alert - error, information, success or warning.
- the icon for display next to the title of the alert box, you can pick the icon from the [icon dialog](/learn/app-development/widgets/basic/icon/).

## Script Access

**Dialog** widget in your project can be accessed by associating the open and _close_ properties of the dialog with an event of any other widget. The dialog can be accessed through scripting by adding _DialogService_ to the _page controller_ and adding the code for _open_ and _close_ as shown below, here we are displaying an alert dialog on click of a button: Click event of the button should trigger the following JavaScript code:

```js
Page.button3Click = function($event, widget) {
     Page.Widgets.alertdialog1.open();
 }
```

For hiding dialog:
```js
/** function called on button1 click **/
        Page.button1Click = function($event, widget) {
            Page.Widgets.alertdialog1.close();
        };  
```
