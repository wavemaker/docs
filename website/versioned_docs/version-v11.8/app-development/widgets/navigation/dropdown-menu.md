A **menu** displays grouped navigation actions. The drop-down menu is typically used inside the navigation header to display a list of related links on a mouse hover or click on the trigger element.

Dropdown Menu can be used as:

1. **Command menus**, which initiate an action based on the option user selects. Each menu item consists of a discrete option or action that can affect the app, the view, or selected elements within a view.
2. **Navigation menus**, which take users to a new location. Note that menus should not be used as a primary method for navigation within an app.

**WaveMaker Dropdown Menu** widget allows one to display a label, an icon and a link to be opened on click event. The data source for the Menu can be a Model variable or from a database. The structure of the data source should contain fields which can be set:

- **Action label** - usually caption;
- **Action icon** - some graphic image;
- **Action link** - specifying the action to be performed and
- **sub action** for a nested menu structure.

The **Menu Layout** - _horizontal_ or _vertical_ and **Menu Position** can be set as per the app requirements

| --- | --- |
| Action Task | Task for menu items generated dynamically. This is the action that will be triggered when the user clicks on the Menu Item. It can be a script like: `Widgets.label1.show` or `Variables.v1.invoke()`     Execution order on click of Node:   1. If provided _onSelect_ will be executed first.   2. If provided _Action_ will be executed next.   3. If provided _Action link_ will be executed last. |
| User Role | Role for menu items generated dynamically. You can assign the property to 'userrole' which contains comma separated user roles. Each item will be evaluated with given 'userrole' for that item to that of the logged in user roles, from security. If any of the user roles bound to 'userrole' property matches then that menu item will be shown else will be hidden. |
| Sub Actions | When a menu widget is required the sub-items can be mentioned in the children. It can be bound to a variable or set to a field from the Dataset Value variable. |
| **Behavior** |
| Show | Showing determines whether or not a component is visible. It is a bindable property. |
| Load on Demand (visible only when show property is bound to a variable) | When this property is set and show property is bound, the initialization of the widget will be deferred till the widget becomes visible. This behavior improves the load time. Use this feature with caution, as it has a downside (as we will not be able to interact with the widget through script until the widget is initialized). When show property is not bound the widget will be initialized immediately. |
| Link Target | This defines the app behavior on click of the Item Link.    - `_blank` Opens the linked document in a new window or tab;   - `_self` Opens the linked document in the same frame as it was clicked (this is the default value);   - `_parent` Opens the linked document in the parent frame;   - `_top` Opens the linked document in the full body of the window. |
| Auto Close | This property defines the behavior of menu closing, it can be:    - outsideClick - close the menu when clicked outside of the menu,   - always - when a menu item is selected or on click outside menu, or   - disabled - do not close once opened.  |
| Animation on to content | This property controls the animation of the menu items. It can be set to _slide, fade, or scale_. Note: This feature works only in the run mode. |
| **Graphics** |
| Icon Class | This bindable property defines the class of the icon that is applied to the button. |
| **Format** |
