We will use the popover to display the list of employees of a particular department using the Sample HRDB Database.

## 1. Import Database

[Import Sample HRDB](/learn/app-development/services/database-services/working-with-databases/) and in the [Query Editor](/learn/app-development/services/database-services/working-with-queries) write two queries - one to obtain **Employee count** for a given department and one for **Employee Picurl**. 

`Select count(*) from EMPLOYEE where EMPLOYEE.DEPTID = :deptid` `Select EMPLOYEE.PICURL from EMPLOYEE where EMPLOYEE.DEPTID = :deptid`

## 2. Create a **popover page**

Create a popover page and select a blank template.
- Drag and drop a **List** onto the canvas space, select the _data source_ to the _dataset_ of the _Emp_Picurl_ query variable created in the first step and set the _layout_ to _Media List_.

- Bind the _picture_ widget to the picurl field of the query variable, delete the label from the list on canvas.

## 3. Drag and drop Popover Widget

1. Open the page where you want to have the popover, drag and drop the popover widget.

2. Set the **content source** property to the _partial_ and the **content** as _popover page_ created in the previous step and bind the **badge** value to the _Emp_Count value_. Content defines the page to be displayed when the popover link is clicked and badge indicates the number of items that will be displayed in the content.

3. We have added a select widget for the user to select the department for which they want to see the employee list. Drag and drop a **select widget** and bind it to _Department Dataset_. Set the **display field** to _name_, and **data field** to _deptid_.

4. Be sure you bind the **data field of both the query variables** to the _select widget datavalue_, and set the **Auto Update** to true.

## 4. Run the application

Run the application and see the menu in action.

## 5. Configurations and Settings

Repeat the steps 2 till 3 for the following:

- Set the **content source** property to be _inline_
- Set the _content_ as follows, we have used the list HTML from the partial page created in steps 2,3,4

```html
<wm-livelist listclass="media-list" itemclass="media" template="true" dataset="bind:Variables.HrdbExecuteEmpPic.dataSet" name="livelist1">
        <wm-listtemplate layout="media" name="listtemplate1">
            <wm-container class="media-left media-top" paddingleft="15" name="container1">
                <wm-picture picturesource="bind:Variables.HrdbExecuteEmpPic.dataSet.PICURL" name="Picture" class="media-object"></wm-picture>
            </wm-container>
        </wm-listtemplate>
    </wm-livelist>
```
