**Popover Widget** can be used to display a list of items on click event. An example of this would be the Notifications displayed on the Facebook page.

Popovers are an interactive way to provide a secondary form of navigation in many different locations outside the dedicated areas. This UI pattern has the advantage of providing a lightweight and straightforward way of viewing additional information or taking a particular action, but they do so without pulling the user out of their current activity.

Popovers “pop-up” when the user performs a certain action or gets to a specific place in the app, showing the relevant information/controls associated with that particular action/place in the UI. The original content or place in the app is still visible in the background, but the popover gives you the option of tweaking certain things or learning about what comes next. The popover gets the user’s attention and provides important notifications where needed. At the same time, however, users can easily dismiss the popover and return back to whatever they were originally doing by simply tapping or swiping the screen.

### Behavior

| **Property** | **Description** |

| Show | Showing determines whether or not a component is visible. It is a bindable property. |
| Load on Demand   (visible only when show property is bound to a variable) | When this property is set and show property is bound, the initialization of the widget will be deferred till the widget becomes visible.
