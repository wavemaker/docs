## Overview

Dragging and dropping a dialog creates a **view** containing the dialog. The view can be selected from the **Page Structure** or from the **tabs** given at the bottom. The display of the dialog box at runtime is usually associated with the _onClick_ event of a **Button** widget. You can also trigger the dialog by calling methods from _JavaScript_.

## Login Dialog

Login Dialog is a popup window that displays Login page content and can be dismissed by the user. Especially used to refresh the membership or for additional confirmation. The events that can be set include _onSuccess_, _onError_ and _onClose_.

## Script Access

**Dialog** widget in your project can be accessed by associating the open and _close_ properties of the dialog with an event of any other widget. The dialog can be accessed through scripting by adding _DialogService_ to the _page controller_ and adding the code for _open_ and _close_ as shown below, here we are displaying an alert dialog on click of a button: Click event of the button should trigger the following JavaScript code:

```js  
Page.button3Click = function($event, widget) {
     Page.Widgets.logindialog1.open();
 }
```

For hiding dialog:

```js
/* function called on button1 click */
        Page.button1Click = function($event, widget) {
            Page.Widgets.logindialog1.close();
        };
```
