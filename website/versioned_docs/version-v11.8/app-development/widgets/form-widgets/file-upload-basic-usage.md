1. Drag and drop a **FileUpload** widget onto the canvas.
2. You will be prompted to create a _FileServiceUploadFile_ Variable. For this demo purpose, retain the default selections of _Update data on input change_. **NOTE**: You can create and use any service, but keep in mind that the operation selected should be able to accept file data. The default file service _uploadFile_ operation fulfills this requirement. [![](/learn/assets/fu_servicevar.png)](/learn/assets/fu_servicevar.png)
3. From the Properties panel, set theÂ **Multiple** property to true, this will enable us to upload multiple files, else you can upload a single file at a time. [![fu_props](/learn/assets/fu_props.png)](/learn/assets/fu_props.png)
