**ToggleÂ widget** represents a physical switch that allows users to turn things on or off. Use Toggle controls to present users with exactly two mutually exclusive options (like on/off), where choosing option results in an immediate action.

## Properties

| **Property** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| Caption | The caption is the text that the end user sees on your label. |
| Name | The name is a unique identifier for Toggle widget. |
| **Accessibility** |
| Hint | Any text or an HTML you enter for this property will be shown as a tooltip if the mouse hovers over this widget for 1.5 seconds. |
| Tab index | The tab index attribute specifies the tab order of an element. You can use this property to change the default tabbing order for widget access using the tab key. The value can range from 0 to 32767. The default is 0 and -1 makes the element non-focusable.    **NOTE**: In Safari browsers, by default, Tab highlights only text fields. To enable Tab functionality, in Safari Browser from Preferences -> Advanced -> Accessibility set the option "Press Tab to highlight each item on a webpage". |
| Shortcut key | The shortcut key property specifies a shortcut key to activate/focus an element. (*[See below for details](#shortcut)) |
| **Layout** |
| Width | The width of your widget can be specified in px or % (i.e 50px, 75%). |
| Height | The height of your widget can be specified in px or % (i.e 50px, 75%). |
| **Default Value** |
| Value | This is the default value to display value for an editor widget. Note that the display value is just what the user sees initially, and is not always the dataValue returned by the widget. It is set to _false_ by default. |
| Checked Value | This property defines the value of the widget when the element is in the checked state. The default value is boolean value true. If specified, the value will be of string type. |
| Unchecked Value | This property defines the value of the widget when the element is in the unchecked state. |
| **Validation** |
| Required | A required editor in wm.LiveForm may refuse to save without a required field. |
| **Behavior** |
| Show | Showing determines whether or not a component is visible. It is a bindable property. |
| Load on Demand (visible only when show property is bound to a variable) | When this property is set and show property is bound, the initialization of the widget will be deferred till the widget becomes visible. This behavior improves the load time. Use this feature with caution, as it has a downside (as we will not be able to interact with the widget through script until the widget is initialized). When show property is not bound the widget will be initialized immediately. |
| Disabled | If the disabled property is true (checked) the value of the editor cannot change. The widget becomes display-only. |

**Shortcut key**: The shortcut key property specifies a shortcut key to click the button. The way of accessing the shortcut key is varying in different browsers:

| Browser | Shortcut key Trigger |
| --- | --- |
| Internet Explorer | [Alt] + shortcut key |
| Chrome | [Alt] + shortcut key (_Windows/Linux_) |
|  | [Control] [Alt] + shortcut key (_MAC_) |
| Firefox | [Alt] [Shift] + shortcut key (_Windows/Linux_) |
|  | [Control] [Alt] + shortcut key (_MAC_) |
