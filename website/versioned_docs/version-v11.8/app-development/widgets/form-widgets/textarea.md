**Textarea widget** represents a multi-line plain-text editing control. It can be used in a web application for adding comments and feedback forms as a plain text editor.

## Properties

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Name | The name is a unique identifier for textarea widget. |
| Placeholder | A placeholder is text to show in the editor when there is no value. A common use of this is a search box that says in faint gray italicized text "Search..." which disappears as soon as the user starts to edit the text box. This is a useful alternative to a caption if you are constrained in space and asking for something simple of the user. |
| **Accessibility** |
| Hint | Any text or an HTML you enter for this property will be shown as a tooltip if the mouse hovers over this widget for 1.5 seconds. |
| Tab index | The tab index attribute specifies the tab order of an element. You can use this property to change the default tabbing order for widget access using the tab key. The value can range from 0 to 32767. The default is 0 and -1 makes the element non-focusable.    **NOTE**: In Safari browsers, by default, Tab highlights only text fields. To enable Tab functionality, in Safari Browser from Preferences -> Advanced -> Accessibility set the option "Press Tab to highlight each item on a webpage". |
| Shortcut key | The shortcut key property specifies a shortcut key to activate/focus an element. (*[See below for details](#shortcut)) |
| **Layout** |
| Width | The width of your widget can be specified in px or % (i.e 50px, 75%). |
| Height | The height of your widget can be specified in px or % (i.e 50px, 75%). |
| **Default Value** |
| Value | This is the default value to display value for an editor widget. Note that the display value is just what the user sees initially, and is not always the dataValue returned by the widget. |
| **Validation** |
| Required | A required editor in wm.LiveForm may refuse to save without a required field. |
| Maximum characters | Defines the maximum number of characters that can be entered in the editor. |
| Help text (character count) | Display the number of characters entered or left to enter by comparing it with the value you have set in the **Maximum characters** in the text area.    There are three default ways to display the help text property in runtime, including:   1. 0 characters filled out of 100   2. 100 characters left out of 100   3. 0/100     If you want to show this property other than the default values, you can use the bind expression button and change the value of this help text property. You can also provide the `charlength` and `maxchars` properties for binding in the **Use Expression** dialog.    **NOTE:** This property will only show when you set the Maximum characters property.   |
| **Behavior** |
| Auto Focus | This property makes the element get focused automatically when the page loads. |
| Read Only | Selecting this checkbox property prevents the user from being able to change the data value of a widget. |
| Show | Showing determines whether or not a component is visible. It is a bindable property. |
| Load on Demand (visible only when show property is bound to a variable) | When this property is set and show property is bound, the initialization of the widget will be deferred till the widget becomes visible. This behavior improves the load time. Use this feature with caution, as it has a downside (as we will not be able to interact with the widget through script until the widget is initialized). When show property is not bound the widget will be initialized immediately. |
| Disabled | If the disabled property is true (checked) the value of the editor cannot change. The widget becomes display-only. |
| Update value on | If the selected value is `blur`: data value will be updated on blur event, `default`: data value will be updated on key up. |
| Update delay | The amount of delay in milliseconds to update the data value. |
