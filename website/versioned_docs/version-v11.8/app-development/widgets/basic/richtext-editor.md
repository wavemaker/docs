A **richtext editor** widget allows users to create formatted/styled text similar to entering text into a word processor. The richtext editor is used to generate HTML text codes for your website or blog. The toolbar includes text-specific buttons. This makes it easy to create headers, bold text, italic, lists, set text alignment, embed images, audio, video, and more. Users can also add tables, change fonts, apply changes to font size and color.

## Properties

| **Property** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| Name | The name is a unique identifier for Richtext Editor. |
| Placeholder | A placeholder is text to show in the editor when there is no value. A common use of this is a search box that says in faint gray italicized text "Search..." which disappears as soon as the user starts to edit the text box. This is a useful alternative to a caption if you are constrained in space and asking for something simple of the user. |
| **Accessibility** |
| Hint | Any text or an HTML you enter for this property will be shown as a tooltip if the mouse hovers over this widget for 1.5 seconds. |
| Tab index | The tab index attribute specifies the tab order of an element. You can use this property to change the default tabbing order for widget access using the tab key. The value can range from 0 to 32767. The default is 0 and -1 makes the element non-focusable.
NOTE: In Safari browsers, by default, Tab highlights only text fields. To enable Tab functionality, in Safari Browser from Preferences -> Advanced -> Accessibility set the option "Press Tab to highlight each item on a webpage". |
| **Layout** |
| Width | The width of your widget can be specified in px or % (i.e 50px, 75%). |
| Height | The height of your widget can be specified in px or % (i.e 50px, 75%). |
| **Default Value** |
| Value | This is the default value to display value for an editor widget. Note that the display value is just what the user sees initially, and is not always the dataValue returned by the widget. |
| **Behavior** |
| Read Only | Selecting this checkbox property prevents the user from being able to change the data value of a widget. |
| Show | Showing determines whether or not a component is visible. It is a bindable property. |
| Load on Demand (visible only when show property is bound to a variable) | When this property is set and show property is bound, the initialization of the widget will be deferred till the widget becomes visible. This behavior improves the load time. Use this feature with caution, as it has a downside (as we will not be able to interact with the widget through script until the widget is initialized). When show property is not bound the widget will be initialized immediately. |
| Show Preview | Checking this box turns to show the preview section of the editor. |

## Events

| **Event** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| Change | This event handler is called each time your element's value changes. |
