At WaveMaker, we constantly bring ways to make applications more secure. Configure application login settings to add an extra security layer by using concurrent sessions. By taking advantage of the Spring framework in WaveMaker generated application code, Spring Security prevents app users from concurrently authenticating to the same application more than a specified number of times.

## How it works

WaveMaker developers can easily enable maximum concurrent sessions in the Spring framework. It allows you to impose a setting and restrict their application users. You can create a policy to choose what happens when max concurrent sessions have reached. One of the policies is to invalidate the least recently used session.

Max Concurrent sessions can be any positive number or -1 (for unlimited concurrent sessions) but not a zero.

## Configuring Concurrent Sessions in WaveMaker Apps

Concurrent Sessions feature is disabled by default and set to -1 for unlimited concurrent sessions.
The number of concurrent sessions can be configured from the Security dialog.

1. Go to **Security** -> **Authentication** -> **Login Configuration** -> **Max Concurrent Sessions per User**.
2. Set the value for allowed **Max Concurrent Session per User**.
