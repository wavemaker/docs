## Theme Builder

**Theme Builder** is a WaveMaker application that allows you to build a theme by changing **colors**, **typography**, and **styles** of the components and elements without needing to edit the code.

Follow the steps below to build a theme.

- Go to the [WaveMaker Theme Builder](https://apps.wavemakeronline.com/Theme_Builder/#/Dashboard) app.
-  Click the **Explore/Create** themes option.

- On the Editor page, you can customize the existing #HEX values with custom hex, rgba, rgb colors, choose font-family and sizes, and select styles for the component and elements in a few simple steps.

### Step 1: Choose Colors

Change the existing **#HEX** values by choosing colors from the color picker for primary, secondary, and additional colors that you want to modify for the pages.

1. **`Colors`**: Set global colors for components and elements
2. **`LeftNav`**: Set colors for the left navigation
3. **`Header`**: Set colors to change the header styles
4. **`More options`**: Set the colors for the disabling, links, and alerting properties

### Step 2: Apply Font Styles

Customize the typography for the header, body, and caption styles. You can choose the **font-family** from the options available in the dropdown.

1. **`Heading font`**: Select the font-family for headers, which apply to H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, and H6
2. **`Body font`**: Select the font-family for body and captions
3. **`More options`**: Set font-weight, font-size and case sensitive preferences

### Step 3: Select Theme Variation Style

Change the variation of theme style as per the aesthetics. Switching between themes will allow you to preview the relative changes instantly. You can select from the following options.

- **Flat**: The flat-theme includes a solid background to the elements with active states. It also adds an outlined border for user inputs.

- **Material**: The material-theme has a sleek finish with elevated shadows to understand each element's relative importance and focus their attention.

- **Gradient**: The gradient theme fills the content blocks with a linear gradient shade starting from top to bottom.
