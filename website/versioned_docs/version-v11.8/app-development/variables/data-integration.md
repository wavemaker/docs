The **binding layer** provides a _low-code approach_ to defining data flows, interaction, and integration of UI elements with the backend services. 

A major portion of the applicationâ€™s code parts are auto-generated by the platform, leaving the business logic, rules and data flows to be coded by the WaveMaker App developers. UI layer is built such that, decisions to fetch or update the data to the backend services are made when the end-user interacts with widgets or other UI elements. Additionally, business logic functions either on the server-side or on the client-side are invoked at that time.

This functionality is achieved through the Binding layer, using the following components.
