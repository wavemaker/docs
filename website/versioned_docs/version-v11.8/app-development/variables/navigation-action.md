**Navigation Action** provides navigation capabilities to help in navigating from one page or view to another. By default, for every page added to the app, a navigation action is created with the name `goToPage__<pagename>`. You can choose to create a new Navigation Action.

## Action Creation

**Navigation Action** can be used to redirect the user to another page.

1. There are two ways of creating a Navigation Action:
    - Select the Action option from Variables on the Workspace Toolbar 
    
    [![](/learn/assets/action_sel.png)](/learn/assets/action_sel.png) 
    
    and click New Action from the Actions dialog. 
    
    [![](/learn/assets/action_new.png?v=20)](/learn/assets/action_new.png?v=20)

    - or, as a New Action event on any widget 
    
    [![](/learn/assets/action_new1.png)](/learn/assets/action_new1.png)

2. In both the cases, a **New Action** wizard will open.

#### Steps in Action Wizard 

- Choose **Navigation** Type
- Set the **Navigation Target** to:
    - _Previous Page_ to navigate to last visited page
    - _Page_ to navigate to the page as selected in the Page Name field
    - _Accordion_ to navigate to the specified Accordion pane created the selected Page
    - _Tab_ to navigate to the specified Tab pane created on the selected Page
- **Name** - set by default which can be modified
- **Owner** - the scope of the Action being created. By default it is set to Page, you can change it to Application if you want this action to be available across the app.
- Click **Done** to complete the action creation process

3. You will be directed to the Actions dialog, with the new action listed. As you can see:
    - a Navigation Action is created,
    - with the selected target,
    - the properties tab contains Page Name.
