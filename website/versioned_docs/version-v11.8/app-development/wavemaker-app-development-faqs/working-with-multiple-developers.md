Collaborated and continuous development is part of WaveMaker platform. WaveMaker Apps can be shared with multiple users. WaveMaker’s integrated Version Control System (Git) allows pulling changes, merging and resolving conflicts. Apps can also be pushed to External Repos like GitHub or Bitbucket.

Unlike the conventional method where every file or artifact goes through the review/merge process, all the generated code artifacts are auto-merged by the platform, eliminating this responsibility from the developer. As the major portion of the auto-generated code is auto-merged, the developer needs to only review/merge the files which are related to business logic or other files which are modified manually.
