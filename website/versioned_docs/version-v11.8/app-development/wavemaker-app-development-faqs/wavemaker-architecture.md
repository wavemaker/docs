Apps built in WaveMaker follow modern application architectures, separating the UI and the backend layers with well-defined REST APIs. This model gives the needed scalability as the application grows and follows best practices in terms of design and performance. In a traditional development model, such best practices need to be acquired by the development teams and a certain level of expertise is needed to build apps to meet industry standards.
