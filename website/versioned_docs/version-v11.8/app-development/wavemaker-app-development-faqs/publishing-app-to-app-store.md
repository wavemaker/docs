The Automated Build process for a mobile application within WaveMaker can be used to generate a .apk (Android application package) or .ipa file (iOS App Store package). Downloading Cordova/PhoneGap compatible .zip files can be used to build systems manually for Android/iOS platforms.

WaveMaker supports the build for mobile applications in the following three ways:

- Build for Android to generate APK files which can be signed and hosted on PlayStore.
- Send to PhoneGap for a complete package needed to build both apk/ipa files for Android and iOS platforms.
- Manual Build for a downloadable zip file which can be further developed to be hosted on any mobile platform.
