Custom backend services can be built in Java or Spring framework in the form of POJO objects. WaveMaker automatically generates REST APIs for every method exposed and takes care of JSON conversions when the data or the model objects are returned from these APIs and vice versa. 

For more information, see [Integrating Java Services](/learn/app-development/services/java-services/java-service/#overview).
