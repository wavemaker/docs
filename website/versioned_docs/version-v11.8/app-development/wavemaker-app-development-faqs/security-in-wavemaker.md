Apps can be configured to authenticate using standard identity providers like LDAP, Active Directory or a database. Role based access control can be configured for accessing backend services, APIs, UI widgets etc. Additionally, web apps are protected against top 10 OWASP vulnerabilities, such as CSRF, XSS, SQL injection attacks etc. It takes a lot of effort and time for app developers to build all of these security integrations into an app built using traditional development approach.
