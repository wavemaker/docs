See the [FAQs](/learn/app-development/wavemaker-app-development-faqs) for WaveMaker app development.

For WaveMaker apps a modular client-side code (AngularJS, CSS, and HTML) incorporating industry best practices is generated, thus making it Maven complaint. As such, for any WaveMaker app, a zip file can be generated which includes a pom.xml file. This zip file can be imported to any IDE like IntelliJ or Eclipse. The backend artifacts included in the zip file can be modified from the IDE.

The app updated outside of WaveMaker can be reimported into WaveMaker to update the existing project or as a new project.
