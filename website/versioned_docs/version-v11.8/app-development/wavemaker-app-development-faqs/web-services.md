External Web Services such as REST, WSDL or WebSocket can be imported into the App by just providing the URL, parameters and any additional configuration. WaveMaker takes care of type conversions such as Java to JSON, XML to JSON and model object creation for the web service returned responses, making these services readily available for integration with widgets and other business logic components. 

For more information, see [Integrating Web Services](/learn/app-development/services/web-services/web-services/#overview).
