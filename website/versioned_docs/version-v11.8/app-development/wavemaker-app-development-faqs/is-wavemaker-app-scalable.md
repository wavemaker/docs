WaveMaker Apps are built to use stateless architectures making them ready for large scale container-based deployments. Large scale deployments needing high number concurrent requests and low response times can be achieved, by scaling apps to deploy on container based systems.

WaveMaker App acts as a micro service with the REST APIs exposed and load-balanced when deployed on multiple containers. Since, there is no state associated on the server-side, the architecture allows for a high-scalable deployment with client-managed state (on the Angular side).
