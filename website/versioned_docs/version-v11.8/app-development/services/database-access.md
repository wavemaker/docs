Once you have integrated a database into your application, you need a way to access the data within the database and use it from within the app. There are many ways to achieve this:

1. Create a Variable for the Database CRUD APIs auto-generated for each table within the database. This is the easiest and most efficient way to handle the database. This Variable will be of the same structure as the table and can act as a liaison between the app and the database. [Know more about variables](/learn/app-development/variables/database-crud/).
2. [Queries](/learn/app-development/services/db-services/working-with-queries/), [Stored Procedures](/learn/app-development/services/database-services/working-stored-procedures) and [Database Views](/learn/app-development/services/database-services/database-views) can be used to manipulate data. These can be used for getting custom data, work with multiple tables and much more.
3. [Database Tools](/learn/app-development/services/database-tools/) help you in accessing the DB Shell to work with the database directly. It also has provision to run scripts to import/export database.
