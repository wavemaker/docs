When you create a WaveMaker application, you can export the application to your local machine for local development and testing purposes. You can export the project in a ZIP file and a WAR file.

## Export project as ZIP file

To export the project in zip, click **Export** and select **Project as ZIP**; the project files will download.

## Export project as WAR file

To export the project in war, click **Export** and select **Project as WAR**. Next, select the [configured profile](/learn/app-development/deployment/configuration-profiles). For example, WaveMaker displays default profiles; select [development profile](/learn/app-development/deployment/configuration-profiles#development-configuration-profile), or [deployment profile](/learn/app-development/deployment/configuration-profiles#deployment-configuration-profile). If you create a custom profile, select the custom profile name which displays under the **Select Profile** option. On clicking the profile, the project files will download.
