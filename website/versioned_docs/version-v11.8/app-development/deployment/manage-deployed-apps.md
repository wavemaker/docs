WaveMaker **Apps Portal** is a place for you as the project owner to manage the deployed apps. The one-click deployment from Studio hosts the app on WaveMaker Demo Cloud using the [Deployment Profile](/learn/app-development/deployment/configuration-profiles/). Apps Portal will enable the project owner to configure phases and push the apps from one phase to the next. From this portal you can:

1. Configure the deployment environment for each phase - Stage (WME) and Live. The configurations involves setting the various services like Database, Web Services, Security, REST Services
2. Push the app from one phase to another without the need to modify the app. Push will deploy the app into the new deployment environment. A separate URL is generated for each phase. You can version the apps for easy tracking.

## Apps Portal

You can access the Apps Portal in two ways:

1. By selecting **Manage Deployed Apps** button from the Project Dashboard,
2. By using the **Manage App** option under Deploy from the Project Workspace Main Menu - this will open the app for management.

- one the right side you can find
    - the total number of apps owned by you that can be deployed;
    - number of apps deployed in Demo and Live Phases;
    - recent deployment activity
- you will also find cards for the deployed apps,
    - the last deployment activity for that app,
    - if live, the version that is live and the date it was deployed to live
- you can select any app from the listing for management for more details.[know more](#manage-deployed-app).

### SSL Enabled Demo Cloud

:::note
From [10.14.0 release](/learn/wavemaker-release-notes/v10-14-0), WaveMaker introduced SSL for Deployed Apps to [Demo Cloud](/learn/app-development/deployment/pipelines-phases#deployment-environment).
:::

Demo and QA deployments in WaveMaker use secure protocol HTTPS, which is SSL enabled, and therefore, the app is accessible with a URL pattern as follows. 

### SILO workspace (WMO Personal workspace)

**URL**: `http://cloud.wavemakeronline.com/pk8888888n45/TestApp`  

**Updated to**: In the URL, `pk8888888n45` is a Project key.

### Teams and Enterprise (WMO/WME)

**URL**: `http://cloud.wavemakeronline.com/wmshowcase/TestApp`  

**Updated to**: `wmshowcase` is the WaveMaker Online team's name and WaveMaker Enterprise's name in the URL.

:::important
**Impact**: With this change, the existing app URLs do not work. Thus, the users can get updated URL from the Apps portal or deployed apps. You are required to update app URL in all the places where it is used for redirection. For example, when configured as OAuth redirect URL, or when used in other apps as API URL.
:::

### Manage App

By using the **Manage App** option under Deploy from the Project Workspace Main Menu - this will open the app for management.

:::note
This option will be available only for deployed apps.
