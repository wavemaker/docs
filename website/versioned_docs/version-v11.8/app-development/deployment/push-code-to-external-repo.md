WaveMaker provides a default code repository from Gitlab. For convenience, you can choose to have a copy of your project code in an external repository. For pushing code to an external repository, select the **VCS** option from the studio page, and click **Push to External Repo** as shown in the image below.

## Configuring Code Repositories

WaveMaker supports different code repositories on cloud and non-cloud environments. For pushing code to an external repository, you should configure a repository with details including username, password, URL, and branch to push. For pushing the code to an external repository, create a repository for an application before pushing it to an external repo.
