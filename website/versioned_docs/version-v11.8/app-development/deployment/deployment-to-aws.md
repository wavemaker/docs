WaveMaker allows you to deploy your app to your AWS cloud account for Live (and Stage for WME users) phase. 
For more information, see [Release Management](/learn/app-development/deployment/release-management/).

To deploy your app to AWS account, you need to configure the Live (Stage) phase.

:::note
This document covers the Live Phase configuration for your AWS account and is a part of the [Manage Deployed Apps](/learn/app-development/deployment/manage-deployed-apps/).

## Prerequisites

- [AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com/).
- While setting up the AWS account care should be taken to ensure that the IAM key has the permissions as listed in the configuration dialog. [![](/learn/assets/deploy_aws_perms.png)](/learn/assets/deploy_aws_perms.png) **Steps in AWS Configuration**:
