To use form for updating the table, it needs to be bound to a **Data Table** or a **List** widget's **Selected row** property. Here we will see linking Data Table to a Live Form, the same can be replicated for a List. Another easy way to achieve this would be to use the Editable Data Table with Live Form layout.

- Drag and drop a Data Table for the _Employee_ Variable.
- Choose the Data Table (grid) selected item as the datasource for the Live Form. This will set the initial values that will be displayed in the form. [![form_bind_dt](/learn/assets/form_bind_dt.png)](/learn/assets/form_bind_dt.png)
- At runtime, the row selected from the table will be displayed in the form. Make changes and click on save to commit the changes to the database.
