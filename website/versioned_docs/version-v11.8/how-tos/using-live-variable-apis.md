## Showcase

- How the insert, update, delete and read operations of the Live Variable can be used independently as an alternative approach to performing CRUD operations on database tables.
- On inserting or updating a particular entity on the success of this user may like to update records in another table.
- Based on user’s response, for example for **Delete Cart** – the user may have to delete records from the cart.
