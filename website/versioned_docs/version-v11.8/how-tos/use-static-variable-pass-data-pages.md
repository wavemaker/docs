Apart from using [Page Parameters](/learn/app-development/ui-design/page-concepts/), data can be passed between pages using app-level variables. In this section, we see how to use Model Variable to pass data between pages.

## Use Case

- A page displaying a List of Customers.
- On Click of a List Item should navigate to another page with the selected list item values.

## Solution

- Create a app-scoped variable with desired structure (we are creating a Model Variable based on Employee entity)
- Populate the above variable before navigating to next page.
