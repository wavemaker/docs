## Introduction

The document provides the steps to connect to an existing Database in AWS RedshiftDB from a WaveMaker application. A Redshift Database is a cloud-based, big data warehouse solution offered by Amazon. The platform provides a storage system that allows companies to store petabytes of the data in easy-to-access “clusters” that can be queried in parallel.

## Prerequisites

- RedshiftDB connection details such as
  - Host
  - DB name
  - DB Credentials
- Allow connections from WaveMakerOnline (reach out to [support](mailto:support@wavemaker.com) for the Gateway IP)


## Steps

1. Navigate to the Databases section and click on the plus icon to add the Database to the project. From the popup, choose **Connect To a DB** option.
