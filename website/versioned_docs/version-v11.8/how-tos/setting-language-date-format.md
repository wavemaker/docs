You can set the **Home Page**, **Default Language** and **Display Format** for _date and time fields_ in the app from the Project Settings dialog. **Project Settings** can be accessed from project configurations of the [Project Workspace](/learn/app-development/wavemaker-overview/product-walkthrough/#project-workspace).

:::note
The date/time format set at the widget level will get priority over the Project level setting.

:::note
Default Language needs the App Messages to be configured in the selected language. [See here for more](/learn/app-development/widgets/form-widgets/select-locale-usage/).
