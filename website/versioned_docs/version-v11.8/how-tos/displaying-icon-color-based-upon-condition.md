In WaveMaker, widgets can display icon for Panel, Button, and more. You can choose the icons from the list of wavicons or font-awesome icons. You can use glyph icons, available [here](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#glyphicons).

You can change the color of an icon based on a condition. In the following example, see how to change the Icon color based on ckeching a Checkbox.

1. Drag and drop an Icon and a Checkbox widget.
2. For the Checkbox widget, set the `checked value` and `unchecked value` as true and false respectively.

In this example the expression, `text-danger` and `text-info` are the in-build classes of the product which we used to set the color. You can use your own class (defined in the css file) to set the color property.
