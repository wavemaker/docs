This feature is used to change the template, or the layout of the widget. It identifies some of the most used templates and layouts for the widget.

The following are the two types.

1. **Widget Template**: This is the arrangement of the inner elements.

2. **Widget Layout**: This is the arrangement of the outer shell.

## Choosing Widget Template from Canvas

1. Drag and drop the **[List](/learn/app-development/widgets/datalive/list)** widget, and [bind the widget](/learn/app-development/variables/variable-binding#binding-to-widgets) to a dataSet.

2. When you select the **List** widget on the canvas, you can see the template icon on the toolbar. Click the **template** icon.

4. Select the template from the list. The template will be changed and the bindings remain the same from the previous template to the selected-template based on the name of the inner widgets.

Similarly, you can apply a widget template for the **[Cards](/learn/app-development/widgets/datalive/cards)** widget also.

## Choosing Widget Layout from Canvas

1. Drag and drop a **[Wizard](/learn/app-development/widgets/container/wizard)** widget.

2. When you select the **Wizard** widget on the canvas, you can see the layout icon on the toolbar. Click the **layout** icon.
