In this document, the following two use cases explain how to use [Partials in a Prefab](/learn/app-development/custom-widgets/prefab-with-partials).

1. [Partials in Web and Mobile](#partials-in-web-and-mobile)
2. [Using Partial for Data Table with Row Expansion](#data-table-with-row-expansion)

## Partials in Web and Mobile

To build a Prefab for the web and mobile, you develop different partials for different viewports, which helps segregate the code.

**For Web**: Display employees list in a *Data Table* when used in laptops, tablets, or large screens in the landscape mode.  

**For Mobile**: Display the same employee list in a *List* widget for mobile phones and tablets in portrait mode. 

#### Create a Prefab and connect to a DataSource

1. Go to Prefabs tab and click **Create** from the [Project Dashboard](/learn/app-development/wavemaker-overview/product-walkthrough#dashboard-walkthrough]).
2. Enter the name and description for the Prefab.
3. Import [HRDB Swagger](/learn/how-tos/consuming-existing-wm-api-into-another-wm-project) from a Project for using the Employees API.

### Partial of Web

Creating a Web Partial.

1. Click **+** from the **Pages** tab and create a Partial called `webPartial`.

2. Create a [Variable](/learn/app-development/variables/crud-variable) inside `webPartial` for the Employee Entity.

3. Drag and drop the Data Table widget inside the partial and bind it to the created Employee Variable.

4. Go to the Main page and drag and drop a **Container** widget.

5. Choose content as **webPartial**.

7. Preview the App. The Laptop view shows us the Data Table, which is inside `webPartial`.

### Partial for Mobile

Creating the Mobile Partial.

1. Click **+** from the **Pages** tab and create a Partial called `mobilePartial`.

4. Go to the Main Page and drag and drop a **Container** widget.

5. Choose the content as **mobilePartial**.

6. Go to the Device tab and choose **Show in device** as Mobile and Tablet Portrait.

## Data Table with Row Expansion

Build a Prefab that shows Departments from a Data Table. On expanding each Department, see a list of Employees belonging to that particular Department.

1. Click **Create** from the _Prefab_ tab of the [Project Dashboard](/learn/app-development/wavemaker-overview/product-walkthrough#dashboard-walkthrough]).
2. Enter a name and description for the Prefab.
3. Import [HRDB Swagger](/learn/how-tos/consuming-existing-wm-api-into-another-wm-project) from a Project which uses HRDB to use the Employees API.
4. Creating a Partial for Row Expansion.
    - Click the **+** icon from the **Pages** tab and create a Partial called EmployeePartial.
    - Create a Page param **deptID** of type **integer** in the partial to bind the Department ID.
      ![PageParamPartial](/learn/assets/PageParam-Partial.png)
      
    - Create a [Variable](/learn/app-development/variables/crud-variable) inside EmployeePartial for **findAssociatedEmployees** method inside Department. Check Update data on input change, and uncheck Request data on page load.
    - Now, set **deptId** in the variable's Input Fields in Data tab to **deptID** from page params, as shown in the image below:

5. Configure row expansion property.
    - Go to Main Page.
    - Create a [Variable](/learn/app-development/variables/crud-variable) for Department Entity.
    - Drag and Drop a Data Table widget and bind it to the created Department Variable.
    - Go to Advanced Settings of the Data Table.
    - Navigate to the Row Detail tab.
    - Enable Row Expansion property.
    - Content → EmployeePartial.
    - Partial Params → deptID → click on the Bind Property icon.
    - Go to the Widgets tab → DepartmentTable → selecteditem → deptid → click Bind.

6. Preview the App. You'll see the Data Table showing the list of Departments. On expanding the Department, we can see the Employees belonging to that Department in a list.
