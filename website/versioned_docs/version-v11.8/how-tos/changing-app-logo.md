## Steps to change app logo

By default, the WaveMaker logo is used as an app logo. You can change it by replacing the logo file.

There are two ways to change the app logo.

### Method-1: Change the logo from the header

1. Go to the page header, click the logo and navigate to the picture properties, and click bind.
