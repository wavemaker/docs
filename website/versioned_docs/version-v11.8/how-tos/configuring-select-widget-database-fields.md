A Select widget can be used in various ways based on the source of data. Each type of data source needs a different approach. WaveMaker Select widget works in any one of the following ways:

- [Using static list of values](/learn/how-tos/configuring-select-widget-static-list-values/)
- [Using variable data](/learn/how-tos/configuring-select-widget-variable/)
- [Using display and data value fields from a Variable](/learn/how-tos/configuring-select-widget-display-data-fields/)
- Using database fields

The options displayed in the Select drop-down can come from a database, too. For example, you want the user to select department id based on the department they belong to.

1. Drag and drop a Select and Label widget onto the canvas.
2. Bind the Select widget to a database. Here we are using the Department table from the hrdb, [import the sample db](/learn/app-development/services/database-services/working-with-databases/) that comes shipped with Studio and has been imported earlier and [Create Database CRUD Variable](/learn/assets/var_sel.png) [![](/learn/assets/sel_db_var.png)](/learn/assets/sel_db_var.png)
3. Set the Datafield property to the deptid field and Display Field property to the name field of the Live Variable corresponding to Department dataset [![](/learn/assets/sel_db_props.png)](/learn/assets/sel_db_props.png)
4. The selection made by the user is displayed in a Label widget, by binding the select datavalue to it. [![](/learn/assets/sel_list_res.png)](/learn/assets/sel_list_res.png)
5. Preview the app and see the selected item from the Select widget displayed in the label.
