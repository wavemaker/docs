*WaveMaker released another version update with new features and bug fixes.*

## Improvements
---

### Import VCS Project via URL

[Import a Project to WaveMaker Studio](/learn/teams/import-vcs-project) using a repository clone URL.

**Supported VCS providers:** GitHub and GitLab.

### New Formatters

By default, all UI widgets in a WaveMaker app sanitize the content rendered inside them. This prevents any possible [XSS vulnerabilities](/learn/app-development/app-security/xss-prevention) in the app. However, if the developer wants to bypass this sanitization in WaveMaker widgets, the new Formatters **trustAs** or **sanitize** can be used while binding the data to these widgets. [Learn more](/learn/app-development/app-security/xss-prevention#using-formatters)

### Behavior Change when Rendering Richtext in Data table Widget

Richtext data is now rendered as plain text in the Data Table widget to prevent XSS attacks in the generated app.

If you still want to render Richtext as HTML in Data Table, change the column widget's **View Mode** to the **Label** widget. [Learn more](/learn/app-development/app-security/xss-prevention#sanitization-in-datatable-widget)

:::note
For existing apps built on WM 10.12.x or before, this is a manual change required to be done by the app developer.

## Bug Fixes
