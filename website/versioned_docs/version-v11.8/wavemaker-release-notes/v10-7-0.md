*WaveMaker released a new update version with some new features and bug fixes.*

## New Features

---

### Work in Branches

- Branching support for hotfixes and features.
- Create Project in WaveMaker Studio for a specific branch.
- Develop, preview, and test applications of a specific branch in Studio.
- Branching operations such as create, merge and delete are required to perform on the Version Control System (VCS), i.e., outside WaveMaker. For example, Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket UI, etc.
- This feature is enabled on request for WMO Teams subscribed customers.

### Support for Red Shift Database

- Connect to an existing database in AWS RedshiftDB from a WaveMaker application.
- Store petabytes of data in easy-to-access "clusters" that can be queried in parallel.

### Support for SAP Hana Database

- Connect to an existing database in SAP HANA cloud database from a WaveMaker application. 
- It uses an In-Memory strategy to store data for analysis or information processing which is much faster when compared to other conventional databases.

### VCS Enhancements

- Support for grouping, including projects, groups, organizations in VCS.
- Create a project from the existing empty VCS repository URL.
- Show VCS repo URL for a project in Studio Editor.
- Default branch (master/main, etc.) for any VCS repository.

### UI Artifacts now published to NPM

- All the UI artifacts required for generating and building the Angular app are now published to npm.
- This removes the dependency on any other public cloud servers like s3 or other repo providers like maven.
- This also simplifies integrating the WaveMaker app to an enterprise CI/CD pipeline, as standard npm repo is used.

### Query Optimization for Faster DB Imports

- We optimized queries that use databases' metadata to import a database. As a result, these queries help import large databases into your WaveMaker application 600 times faster.

### Support for Latest Database Versions

- Integrate applications with the latest versions of the available database providers. Find the complete list of verified database versions and the [recommended driver versions here](/learn/app-development/services/database-services/database-services#supported-databases-and-versions).

## Other Improvements

---

### UI Enhancements

- For the Datatable widget, added the ability to show **Load more** using the **On Demand** pagination and **Infinite Scroll** to load as scrolling down automatically.
- Added ability to **Group** data for the Select, Search, Chip, Radioset, and Autocomplete widgets.
- Introduced a new property called **Prefer Browser Language** under **Project Settings** with a default value set to `true`. When you set the property to false, the app loads in the default app locale irrespective of the locale set in the browser.
- Performance optimization for the `show-in-device` property for all UI widgets. If a widget is not shown in a device, it will no more be loaded in the DOM itself, making the DOM lighter and preventing any associated XHR calls.


#### Default Options for Richtext, Calender and Progress Circle

Introduced the following methods to get default options provided for the Richtext widget.

- `getDefaultOptions()`: Returns the default.
- `getLib()`: Returns the library used for the widget.
- `overrideDefaults(options)`: Customize the options which the library supports.

### Backend Enhancements

- Prevent HTTP Host header injection attacks. Developers can specify the host names where the WaveMaker application is deployed, and the platform will reject HTTP requests with different Host header values than this list.
- Ability to deploy apps to 1.18 and 1.19 Kubernetes clusters in Digital Ocean.
- Introduced the **Max Authentication Age** property in the project security configuration. It permits developers to allow users to stay authenticated for the specified duration when the identity provider (idP) allows.
- Configure a number of concurrent sessions your application users can have by setting the property `Max Sessions.` These settings can be found in the Login Configuration tab of the Security menu.
