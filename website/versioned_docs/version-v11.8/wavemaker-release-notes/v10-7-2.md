*WaveMaker releases an update with bug fixes.*

## Improvements

---

- The Currency and Number widgets now support a new **Financial** mode of entering data. It is useful in applications dealing with financial information. You can configure this mode by setting the **Input Mode** property on the widget. By default, the value of this property is **Natural** mode.
- For the **Upload widget**, added the ability to aptly highlight the dropzone when you drop a file inside the app. Further, customize this highlighted area by applying the CSS theme to the project.

## Bug Fixes

---

- Fixed an issue related to project build failing in Windows machine when the project is located in drives other than the C drive.
- Fixed an issue related to the List widget's `getIndex()` method returning -1 even when you pass a valid input.

### Data Table

- Fixed an issue related to an error **No data found** while loading data when multi-filter is enabled and contained multiple Datetime widgets.

#### Quick Edit Mode in Data Table

- Fixed an issue related to editing a row. When you select rows and click on a column cell to edit, it selects the next row inline to the previously edited one instead of the clicked one.
- Fixed an issue related to select and deselect events triggering twice when selecting and working in two separate rows.
- Fixed an issue related to the value in the number widget incrementing from zero instead of incrementing from the specified input.
- Fixed an issue related to the keyboard keys not working after saving a row, including arrow, escape and enter keys.
