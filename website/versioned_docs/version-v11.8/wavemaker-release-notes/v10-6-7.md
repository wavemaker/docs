*WaveMaker released a new update version with some bug fixes.*

## Improvements

---

- Introduced a new property called **Show Display Format On** for the Text widget. This property is useful when you apply **Display Format** to the Text widget. It decides when to apply the configured display format. [Learn more](/learn/app-development/widgets/form-widgets/text).
- Introduced the **On Clear** event for the Search widget, which handles clearing the search area.

## Bug Fixes

---

- Fixed an issue related to logout action failing with NPE (Null Pointer Exception) when using SSO OpenID with Horizontal Scaling enabled.
- Fixed an issue related to the **Match Mode** property in the Data table form, forming an altered FilterExperssion for autocomplete, select, and search type.
- Fixed an issue related to values modifying from negative to positive automatically when specified in the Number widget.
- Fixed an issue related to the browser's autocomplete suggestion on the text widget when **Autocomplete** property is turned off.
- We fixed an issue related to the **On Change** event of the Number widget. Precisely, when you use a number widget inside a Live form, it automatically triggered the **On Change** event when there are no actual changes in the *Number* value.
- Fixed an issue related to duplicate Chip widgets adding-up when pressing the Enter key.
- **Mobile**: Disabled the smooth-scroll by default and enabled the native scroll.
