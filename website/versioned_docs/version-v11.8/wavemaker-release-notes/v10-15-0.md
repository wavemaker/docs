## Bug Fixes
---

**Content Security Policy (CSP)**: 
- WaveMaker app now supports strict Content-Security-Policy. Keywords like 'unsafe-eval', 'unsafe-inline' are no more required in the policy, thus making WaveMaker apps more secure and less vulnerable to XSS attacks. Read how to configure the policy in your app [here](/learn/how-tos/configuring-content-security-policy).
