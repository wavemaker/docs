*WaveMaker released a new update version with improvements and bug fixes.*

## Improvements

---

- Enhanced Live Form custom notification actions for `onError` event.
- For Mobile apps, the left panel should open only when the finger is swiped horizontally starting at the extreme left end of the phone.

## Bug Fixes

---

- Fixed issues with reimporting of Swagger/ Open-API.
- After deleting a swagger if a new  or a different swagger is imported with a same name, then you'd see the spinner and it would not go any further. This is now fixed.
- Fixed alignment issues for imported swagger API description in the UI.
- Create a CRUD variable for imported API by selecting from **Select a service type** when drag-and-drop of the widgets.
- For swagger with OAuth (implicit) security was not working as expected in mobile android build, specifically when using swagger in prefab in a mobile project. This is now fixed.
- In a data table, after saving new data in a Live Form, when the **Orderby** for the variable is set to descending, the focus jumps to the last record instead of the newly inserted record. This is now fixed.
- Data for the Live Form was not displaying when the Live Form is inside the List widget. This is now fixed.
- For Search Widget, the **onsubmit** of the `$event.data` event was undefined in WM10. This is now fixed.
- When the main URL is hit in the browser as `https://<domain>/<AppName>`, it was redirecting to Main page `https://<domain>/<AppName>/#/Login?redirectTo=Main` instead of user specific page. This is now fixed.
- Jquery-ui-draggable is added as a part of the WaveMaker library so that it need not be added explicitly by the user to enable Jquery based draggable API support.
- Fixed issue related to iOS mobile apps on entering invalid credentials that showed additional error messages. 
- Fixed issue related to logout operation which was failing in Open ID when invoking it after the session timeout.
