*WaveMaker has released a new update version with bug fixes.*

## Enhancement

---

- When using Central Authentication Server (CAS) as an Authentication provider for an app, you can now configure additional information to be pulled out of CAS for the logged-in user. You can do this by creating a service variable using the `securityService/getSecurityInfo` API

## Bug fixes

---

- When configuring the Live Phase, deployment to the cloud provider was failing. This is fixed.
- Displayed console error: "cannot read property ngForm of undefined" when you use a chip widget inside the wizard widget. This is fixed.
- Number widget validation was not updating when minimum or maximum value is set dynamically from other widgets. This is fixed.
- There were performance issues when the compression property was enabled in a project. This is fixed.
- When adding an app version, it was allowed to add only minor versions upto 0-9. Now, the range is extended to 1-99. For example, 10.19.
