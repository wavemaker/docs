*This release includes minor enhancements and bug fixes to the product.*

## Enhancements
---

### 1. Database Designer Enhancements
**Queries**:
*   Query, when added in WaveMaker apps, generates an API which returns a paginated list of objects. However in cases where the query returns a single record, generating a paginated API is not logical. Now setting a property to indicate that the **Query returns a single result**, you can ensure that the generated API will return an object instead of a paginated list of objects. [#doc](/learn/app-development/services/database-services/working-with-queries/)
*   This release exposes DB query service API for **exporting the query results to excel/CSV**. However, for queries returning a single result, the export API will not be generated. [#doc](/learn/app-development/widgets/datalive/datatable/table-configuration/#export-data)
*   The **Required** option has been introduced for **query parameters**. When set to true, the service variable for the query operation will not be invoked until all the required parameter values are set. [#doc](/learn/app-development/services/database-services/working-with-queries/#query-creation-parameterised)
*   For table columns of date, time data types, the **Server Defined** property can be set to _current datetime_. [#doc](/learn/app-development/services/database-services/working-with-queries/#query-creation-parameterised)

**Procedure**:
*   The **Procedure editor** IntelliSense has been enhanced to display the list of procedures available in the database. Use _ctrl + space_ to view the list of procedures from the schemas defined in the schema filter. On selecting a Procedure, the parameter list is also auto-populated. [#doc](/learn/app-development/services/database-services/working-stored-procedures/#procedure-invocation)
*   The **Required** property has been added for param type IN and IN-OUT. [#doc](/learn/app-development/services/database-services/working-stored-procedures/)

**Database Import**: 
Now database can be imported as **_read-only_** to prevent developers from accidentally making any changes to the database schema. When a database schema is imported the schema is defaulted to read-only. You can change the mode to edit from database configuration screen[#doc](/learn/app-development/services/database-services/database-schema-import-modes/).

### 2. Rest Services
Rest Service Import has been enhanced to support testing and importing APIs which accept multipart form requests (files). [#doc](/learn/app-development/services/web-services/rest-services/#form-data)

### 3. Project Dashboard
*   From the Project Dashboard, you can choose to **Restore** your project to the last stable state in case of corruption of any files within the project. [See here for project recovery options](/learn/app-development/dev-integration/import-export-update-apps/#project-recovery).
*   Now, you can also **Export** the project as a zip file from the Project Dashboard without having to open the project. [#doc](/learn/app-development/wavemaker-overview/product-walkthrough/#project-dashboard)

### 4. Project Configuration Profiles
*   **Pool size** for database connections can be set from the Project Configuration Profile. [#doc](/learn/app-development/deployment/configuration-profiles/#deploy-profile)
*   The **Custom Profiles** for app deployment has been re-instated. These custom profiles can be used ONLY while exporting the project as a WAR file. [#doc](/learn/app-development/deployment/configuration-profiles/#custom-profile)

### 5. OAuth Prefabs
Functionality of OAuth Prefabs has been enhanced to allow you to control the pre-login behavior of the app. **Login Mode** can be set to **auto** for direct navigation to the OAuth providerâ€™s Authorization page. When set to **manual** (default behavior) the OAuth Authorization page will be displayed after the click of the button. [#doc](/learn/app-development/widgets/prefab/oauth-prefabs/)

### 6. UI Enhancements

*   Page rendering and Widget loading have been optimized for a smoother page transition.

* #### Data Table
    *   Edit option for data table bound to updateable database views has been enabled
    *   **Export Format (excel/CSV)** property can be set for Data Table bound to _Query Service Variable_. [#doc](/learn/app-development/widgets/datalive/datatable/table-configuration/#export-data)
    *   Events like **onBeforeformrender** and **onFormrender** can be used to handle the behavior of Inline Live Form associated with Data Table. [#doc](/learn/app-development/widgets/datalive/datatable/datatable-events-methods/)
    *   **refreshData** and **clearFilter** events can be used to customize the Data Table behavior. [#doc](/learn/app-development/widgets/datalive/datatable/datatable-events-methods/#methods)
    *   Inline editing of Data Table bound to Service Variable can be achieved by mapping the Action events. [See here for usage details](/learn/app-development/widgets/datalive/datatable/datatable-events-methods/#inline-edit).

*   **Variable Binding**: Live Variable associated with a Database Entity will not display the related (one-to-many) entity nodes.
*   **List & Cards**: Using the new _On Demand_ **Pagination** option the list/card items can be loaded when needed. A Load More button will be displayed which when clicked will load the next page items. [#list_doc](/learn/app-development/widgets/datalive/list/configuration/#pagin) [#cards_doc](/learn/app-development/widgets/datalive/cards/card-configuration/#pagin)
*   **Tabs**: Using the _Badge_ property you can assign badge values to each tab pane. [#doc](/learn/app-development/widgets/container/tabs/#properties)
*   **Progress Bar**: _Display format_ has been enhanced to allow selection of decimal options instead percentage and absolute values. [#doc](/learn/app-development/widgets/basic/progress-bar/)
*   **File Upload**: _selectedFile_ details like file name, type, and size are exposed and can be used for further processing, like displaying the details or saving in database etc.. [#doc](/learn/app-development/widgets/form-widgets/file-upload/)
*   **Theme**: A new Neon theme has been introduced.
