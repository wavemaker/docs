*WaveMaker releases an update with bug fixes.*

## New Features

---

#### Added support for generating Android App Bundle (AAB) file in AppChef and wm-cordova-cli

AAB is new and alternative to the Android Application Package (apk). Google introduced this format to reduce the size of the installer. For more information, see [Generating .aab files using wm-cordova-cli or AppChef](/learn/blog/2021/07/19/aab-support) and [Mobile Build - AppChef](/learn/hybrid-mobile/mobile-build-appchef).

#### Web accessibility recognized as WCAG and ADA standards

Now, configure the aria-label values. Web accessibility allows you to develop websites, tools, and technologies that help people with disabilities use them. It supports Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).

## Improvements

---

- Added support to view contents of docker file in WaveMaker Studio from File Explorer; this allows you to view, edit, update and delete the file.

- Fixed an issue related to imported OpenAPI/Swagger APIs showing 401 error response, particularly when security is enabled.
