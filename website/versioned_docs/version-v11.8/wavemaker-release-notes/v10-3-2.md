*WaveMaker released a new update version with bug fixes.*

## Bug fixes

---

- Calender widget: New method exposed to integrate Google events with WaveMaker app. For more information, see [Google Calendar Integration](/learn/how-tos/calender-usage-google-calendar-integration).
- For mobile apps, when switching the screen size, the variable calls were failing. Furthermore, when modifying a variable, it was freezing the studio screen. This is now fixed.
- Charts were not loading when using it inside a container widget when you conditionally show or hide the container, including for GridLayout, and Panel. This is fixed.
- When a DataTable is set to not load any data upon page load, a network call to fetch data was being made in some cases. This is now fixed.
- Auto-complete for Live widgets was not showing results when related entity field is set to autocomplete widget with custom display expression. This is now fixed.
