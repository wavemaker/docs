*WaveMaker released a new update version with some bug fixes.*

## Improvements

---

- Introducing support for creating [Partials in Prefab](/learn/app-development/custom-widgets/prefab-with-partials). You can create on-demand pages using features like [Row Expansion](/learn/app-development/widgets/datalive/datatable/row-expansion-data-table) and [Page Dialog](/learn/app-development/widgets/page-dialog).
- On the OpenID authentication success, we add AccessToken in the security attributes with the server-only scope. You can use this AccessToken in the web services or any backend code by autowiring the security service.
- Enhanced the ability to choose files when you click anywhere in the File upload widget area.

## Bug Fixes
