**Teams** is a collaborative development environment on [WaveMakerOnline](https://www.wavemakeronline.com/).  
**Team Portal** is an admin console where you can manage projects, add or remove team members, manage roles, grant permissions, manage code repositories, and more. With Teams, you can choose to administer the organization data either by a single person, or have it managed by multiple administrators.
