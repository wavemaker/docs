## User Roles

A user's role in your team defines their level of access to your team, its settings, and resources. You can make people **Team Admin**, or **Studio Users** for your team. For security and usability, each feature of the Team is designed to be available to users based on the role assigned to the individual user.


## What user roles are available

* **Team Admin** can access and use all the features and resources of the Team, access **Team Portal**, manage projects, add/remove users, customize settings, change roles of team members etc in the Team. This role is the most powerful in the Team. Teams can have more than one team admin to avoid lapses in ownership.

The **Team Admin** can promote any member of the team to team admin.

* **Studio User** can access platform and collaborate on projects, deployments etc. This is the default role given to user and doesn't have access to Team portal.


From the user list, you can

* Create a user or add an existing user
* View or edit a user’s role  
* Block a user, to prevent users from logging in to your team
* Delete a user

## Block a User

Block a user account to limit or remove access to the team resources. When you block a user account, the account status moves from **Active** to **Blocked**. The blocked users can no longer have access to the team. When you unblock a previously blocked user account, the user will be able to access the resources which the user earlier had access to. If you're not sure of removing the user from Team and associated resources, you can **block** the user from accessing the account.

:::note
**Blocked** users will not be counted against the subscription.
:::

You can block or unblock a user by using the **Block/Unblock** icon located on each row in the table as shown in the image below.

## Remove or Delete a User

Deleting an account cannot be undone. After deleting an account, the user does not show on the **Users** page and would be removed from the resources which they were associated with. When you again add a previously-deleted user account, you'll need to reassign the resources to the user.

You can delete a user by using the **Delete** icon located on each row in the table.

If user to be deleted is the only owner in one or more projects, you must transfer ownership of those projects to another person.
