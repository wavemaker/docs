WaveMaker offers various features which make the Mobile App building process easy. These features in the form of device widgets, device variables etc. allow you to concentrate on implementing the business logic by taking care of platform specific adaptation.

## Platform Look and Feel

By choosing the appropriate Device setting, you can see the UIÂ effect at design time and at runtime from the Preview option.

### Design Mode Preview Mode

The Mobile Themes give native look-n-feel on the same page based on the Platform (IOS, Android etc.). Most importantly themes adhere to design guidelines of the Platform.

**Device Widgets** allow your Mobile App to take advantage of Device Functionality. Two such widgets are available:

### Camera
Camera gives control to the device camera and once the camera is clicked the control is passed back to the App.

### Barcode Scanner
Barcode scanner launches the scanner. The captured images further process within the App.
