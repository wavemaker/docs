## AWS Lambda Connector

With AWS Lambda, you can run code without provisioning or managing servers. You pay only for the compute time that you consume—there’s no charge when your code isn’t running. You can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service—all with zero administration. Just upload your code and Lambda takes care of everything required to run and scale your code with high availability. You can set up your code to automatically trigger from other AWS services or call it directly from any web or mobile app.

This Connector enables you to invoke the lambda function from a WaveMaker application.

## AWS SNS Connector

Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is a web service that coordinates and manages the delivery or sending of messages to subscribing endpoints or clients. In Amazon SNS, there are two types of clients—publishers and subscribers—also referred to as producers and consumers. Publishers communicate asynchronously with subscribers by producing and sending a message to a topic. Subscribers (that is, web servers, email addresses, Amazon SQS queues, AWS Lambda functions) consume or receive the messages.
The AWS SNS Connector enables you to add Push Notifications capability to WaveMaker web and mobile applications. It leverages SNS service and uses the FCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging) to send the notification to Web Browsers, Android and iOS Devices.
