# How to Create a Prefab

Prefabs are reusable components that can be shared across projects.

## Creating a Prefab

1.  Go to the **Project Dashboard**.
2.  Click on **Create** and select **Prefab**.
3.  Give your Prefab a name and description.
4.  Build the UI and logic just like a normal page.
5.  Define properties and events to expose to the consumer.

## Publishing

Once your Prefab is ready, you can publish it to the workspace or export it as a ZIP file.
