## New Features

### Sharing Artifacts Between WME Setups

Introducing a new feature with which users can now share the artifacts across different environments. This feature enhances collaboration across environments. 

A new Export option is added that will help to export the artifact from one environment. It is placed in the Marketplace of another environment. The users in another environment can consume the artifact for further use.

### Expo 50 Upgrade

Expo updated from version 49 to 50 for React Native apps. This includes an upgrade to React Native 0.73, new features, improvements, and bug fixes.

With performance improvements, the application build process is now faster. Debugging and resolving issues are more efficient with detailed error messaging and stack traces for component-based errors.

### Angular 17 Upgrade

We are upgrading our platform to Angular 17 from Angular 16 with better performance and user experience.

### Enable SPA Behaviour

Introducing Single Page App behaviour to improve the performance and page load experience of apps. With this feature, navigation between pages with the same layout does not require a page refresh.

This feature will be enabled by default for the newly created applications and needs to be enabled for the older applications.

## Enhancements

### React Native Enhancements

**Updating Date Format in i18N:**

Introduced support to update the date format for the Internationalization (i18n) service through JavaScript. Use the below code to update, `App.getDependency(“i18nService”).dateFormat = “dd-MM-yyyy”;`. 

In i18N, users can now update the date format not only using the date format option available under the Formats section in the Localized Messages dialog but also through JavaScript.

**CSS Style Classes in Slider Widget:**

Added two new CSS style classes in Slider widget,`app-slider-track` and `app-slider-thumb`, where
- `app-slider-track` : To customize the slider track.
- `app-slider-thumb` : To customize the thumb used in the slider track.

**Navigation in Wizard Widget:**

Added `headernavigation` property in Wizard widget which can be set to `false` to disable navigation through Wizard stepper header numbers.

**Range in Slider Widget:**

Added support to set range in the Slider widget by adding the following properties.
- Range
- Datatype
- Dataset
- Datafield
- Displayfield
- Displayexpression
- Tooltip expression
- Showmarkers
- Showtooltip

**Wheel Date Picker:**

Enhanced the date-picking experience by adding `iswheelpicker` property in the Markup script. Users can set it to false to fall back to the modal date picker.

**SSL Certificate Pinning**

Added support to automatically update the SSL domain certificate in APK by setting `loadOnStartup` property value as `true` in the `wm_rn_config.json` file.

**Service Definitions:**

Introduced a provision to provide the service definitions locally instead of fetching them from the cloud. This feature would enhance the application performance by reducing unnecessary service definitions.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue with Date and Datetime widget where the user was unable to set the default time.
- Fixed an issue with i18N binding to the table column in the Data Table widget.

- Fixed an issue where XSS input and output sanitization were not being applied to the char type array in API requests and responses.
- Fixed XSS output sanitization that was not being applied for the string type API response.
- Fixed an issue with double encoding in the Database service patch API's response when XSS sanitization was set to input or both input and output.

### React Native Fixes

- Fixed an issue where the user was unable to preview the application when a slider widget was used.
- Fixed an issue with the Form field where the conditional property in the advanced settings was not functioning properly.
