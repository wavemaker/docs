WaveMaker has released version 11.3.5, which includes enhancements for the Googlemap Prefab, pagination, as well as bug fixes for nested menus, app crashing, and database queries and procedures.

## Enhancements


- [Googlemaps Prefab](/learn/app-development/widgets/prefab/googlemaps/) updated from version 7.0.0 to 7.0.1. This update introduces new properties, allowing users for setting more precise control on the positioning of the zoom and street view controls on the map. Googlemaps Prefab's new properties include: 
    - **Zoom Control Position**
    - **Street View Control Position**  

- **Infinite Scroll** and **OnDemand** pagination introduces the **Show View Less Button** property, allowing you to add the "View Less" button when scrolled excessively.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed the application crash and response issue when a large number of roles (1000s) and several pages are configured under the **Security** settings.
- Fixed the **setSummaryRowData()** function returning incorrect data when used with procedures and database queries.
- Fixed the highlighting of the active Nested menu items on the header navigation. The selected menu, including sub-menus now properly highlights as expected.
