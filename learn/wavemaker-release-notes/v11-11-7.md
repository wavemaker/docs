## Enhancements

### React Native

<details>
<summary>

Introduced `.app-list-content-container` class for List widget

</summary>

A new CSS class `.app-list-content-container` has been added to the **List widget**.  
This class targets the container that contains all the list items inside the list widget.
It can be used to apply styling (e.g., padding, background, layout behavior) to the entire list content block.

</details>

<details>
<summary>

Added `.app-list-item-column-wrapper` class for List widget

</summary>

A new CSS class `.app-list-item-column-wrapper` has been introduced for the **List** widget.  
This class targets the **row container** that holds multiple list items when:
- **List Direction** is set to **Vertical**, and
- **Items per Row** is greater than **1**.

It allows developers to style the row container directly, for example, by adding spacing or background styling around grouped list items.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Introduced new styling classes for Switch widget icons</summary>

Added two new CSS classes to customize icon styling in the **Switch** widget:

- `.app-switch-icon` — applies styles to the icon when the switch is in the **unselected** state.
- `.app-switch-selected-icon` — applies styles to the icon when the switch is in the **selected** state.

These classes allow more control over the visual appearance of switch icons based on selection state.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Added responsive support for Items Per Row in List widget</summary>

The **List widget** now supports configuring **Items Per Row** separately for different screen sizes.  
Instead of a single **Items Per Row** field, Studio now provides three sub-fields:

- **Mobile**: Set items per row for mobile devices.
- **Tablet Portrait**: Set items per row for tablets in portrait orientation.
- **Laptop/Tablet Landscape**: Set items per row for laptops and tablets in landscape mode.

This allows developers to easily create responsive layouts tailored for various device sizes.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Revamped Splash Screen Configuration with preview</summary>

Significant improvements have been made to the **Splash Screen Configuration** in Studio, enabling a more visual and flexible setup experience.

### Key Enhancements

- **Background Color**: Easily set background color for the splash screen.
- **Splash Icon**: Choose a custom icon.
- **Icon Width**: Set desired width for the splash icon.
- **Splash Animation**: Add a Lottie JSON animation to be shown **after** the splash screen.

### Dark and Light Mode Support
All configurations (background, icon, animation) can now be defined separately for both **Light** and **Dark** modes based on the user's device theme.

### Live Preview Modes
A built-in **Preview** tool lets you visualize splash configurations in real-time:

- **Background** – Displays the configured splash screen background and icon.
- **Animation** – Shows the splash animation in isolation.
- **App Launch** – Simulates a full app launch: splash screen → animation → mock home page.

These updates make splash screen setup intuitive, visual, and aligned with real device behavior.

## Bugs

### Web

<details>
<summary>Fixed column metadata not updating on dataset change in Data Table widget</summary>

When changing the dataset binding in the Data Table widget, the Columns section in Advanced Settings continued to show fields from the old dataset. This has been fixed now, column metadata now refreshes correctly based on the newly bound dataset.
</details>

<details>
<summary>

Fixed `selectItem()` issue with Multi-Select in Data Table

</summary>

Resolved an issue where the `selectItem()` method was not working inside the **On Data Render** callback when **Multi-Select** was enabled in the **Data Table** widget.  
It now works as expected.
</details>


### React Native

<details>
<summary>Fixed issues related to Slider widget</summary>

This update addresses multiple issues in the Slider widget:

1. Tooltip and Data Value Mismatch  
   - The displayed tooltip value was not always in sync with the widget’s actual `datavalue`. This mismatch has now been corrected.
 - On iOS, navigating to the page with slider was causing app crash.  

2. Large Range Handling Issues (e.g., Min: 100, Max: 100000)
  
   - The slider was allowing values outside the defined range, and the tooltip was not rendering correctly for large numbers (3–4 digits). Tooltip alignment has also been corrected.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Fixed crash issue with WavePulse debugging when certain styles are used</summary>

Resolved an issue where the mobile app would crash when connecting with **WavePulse** for debugging if specific styles (like `box-shadow`) were applied in the app.

The app now handles such styles properly, ensuring **WavePulse** debugging works without causing crashes.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Fixed partial rendering issue in Popover widgets within Prefabs</summary>

Fixed an issue where **Popover widgets** inside **Prefabs** failed to render their **Partials**.
After this update, **Partials** nested within **Popovers** inside **Prefabs** now render correctly.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Fixed incorrect space distribution in Flex Layout widget, with Flexgrow on its items</summary>

Resolved an issue where applying **Flexgrow** to *inearlayoutitem* did not correctly distribute available space among the Flex Layout items.  
With this fix, flex containers now respect **Flexgrow** values, ensuring proper space distribution across Flex Layout items.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Resolved accessibility issues in Picture and Icon widgets</summary>

Improved accessibility support for **Picture** and **Icon** widgets by fixing compatibility issues with screen readers and other accessibility tools.  
These widgets now provide better support for assistive technologies, ensuring more accessible applications.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Fixed crash issue with custom colors in Column and Bar charts</summary>

Resolved an issue where binding an array of custom colors to the **Custom Colors** property in the **Column** and **Bar** chart widgets caused the app to crash.  
With this fix, custom colors are now correctly applied to both **bars** and **legends** without causing crashes.
