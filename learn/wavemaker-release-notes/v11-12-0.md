WaveMaker 11.12.0 introduces WMX Widgets, enabling seamless use of custom React Native components as native WaveMaker widgets. Optimized React Native app and build processes now deliver smaller APKs, faster performance, and lighter apps. This update also brings UI enhancements and key fixes across Web, React Native, and Studio.

## Features

## React Native

<details>
<summary>Introducing WMX Widgets</summary>

You can now seamlessly integrate your own **custom React Native components** into WaveMaker as fully functional widgets.  

**WMX Widgets** act as a smart wrapper around your component, giving it all the built-in capabilities of WaveMaker widgets, including **property binding**, **event handling**, **script access** and **theme styling**, while letting you retain full control over its internal React Native logic.  

This enables you to:
- Add **unique UI elements** or highly specialized features not available in the default widget set.
- Avoid workarounds by using your custom component as a **first-class citizen** in your app.
- Continue leveraging WaveMaker’s design and development ecosystem for styling, binding, and debugging.
- **AI-friendly development** – WMX Widgets are designed to work well with AI-assisted coding tools, making it faster and easier to develop, refine, and extend custom widgets.

Whether you’re building a niche interactive component, experimenting with a custom visual style, or bringing in advanced native capabilities, WMX Widgets make it easy to extend WaveMaker without sacrificing integration.

## Enhancements

### React Native

<details>
<summary>App Size and Perfomance Optimization</summary>

We have made significant optimizations to both our app and its build process to reduce APK size.

Existing WaveMaker apps were almost twice as large compared to a blank Expo app.  
For example, the APK size of a simple HelloWorld app built using Expo is **25.3 MB**, whereas the same app built using WaveMaker was **53.4 MB**.

To address this, we:
- Removed unused libraries.
- Enabled ProGuard and resource shrinking in release builds.

**Impact:**  
The APK size of the WaveMaker HelloWorld app has been reduced by **17.2 MB** (from **53.4 MB** to **36.2 MB**).  
This reduction also led to improvements in memory usage and CPU performance.

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

</details>
<details>
<summary>Introduced "Navigation Bar Style" Property for Pages in Edge-to-Edge Mode</summary>

A new **"Navigation Bar Style"** property has been introduced for pages to control the appearance of the **Android system navigation bar** when the app is in **Edge-to-Edge** mode.

Available options:
- `light`: Almost transparent with very light opacity.
- `dark`: Semi-transparent with medium opacity.

This allows developers to better match the navigation bar with the app’s overall visual theme.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexWrap: 'wrap', gap: '10px' }}>
  <figure style={{ margin: 0, maxWidth: '300px', width: '100%', textAlign: 'center' }}>
    <img src={light} alt="Light Nav Bar Style" style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }} />
    <figcaption>Light Nav Bar Style</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <figure style={{ margin: 0, maxWidth: '300px', width: '100%', textAlign: 'center' }}>
    <img src={dark} alt="Dark Nav Bar Style" style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }} />
    <figcaption>Dark Nav Bar Style</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

</details>

<details>
<summary>Enhanced: Fallback Screen Now Supports Style Customization</summary>

The **Fallback Screen** has been enhanced to support **custom styling** through CSS.  
You can now target specific sections of the fallback UI using the following CSS classes:

- `.app-error-fallback`
- `.app-error-fallback-info-container`
- `.app-error-fallback-image`
- `.app-error-fallback-error-card`
- `.app-error-fallback-error-card-row`
- `.app-error-fallback-toggle-button`
- `.app-error-fallback-stack-card`
- `.app-error-fallback-stack-header`
- `.app-error-fallback-stack-container`
- `.app-error-fallback-button-container`

This provides developers with greater control over the **look and feel** of the error fallback UI.
</details>

<details>
<summary>

Introduced `.app-list-content-container` class for List widget

</summary>

A new CSS class `.app-list-content-container` has been added to the **List widget**.  
This class targets the container that contains all the list items inside the list widget.
It can be used to apply styling (e.g., padding, background, layout behavior) to the entire list content block.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Binding Support for Form Action's Class</summary>

The **`class` field** for **Form Actions** (e.g., Submit, Cancel buttons) in the **Form widget's Advanced settings** is now **bindable**.  
This allows developers to apply **conditional styling** using expressions via the **"Use Expression"** tab in the bind dialog.

Example use case: dynamically change button color or visibility based on form state.
</details>

## Bugs

## Web

<details>
<summary>Fixed: Auto Complete Form Field Value Not Captured via Keyboard</summary>

When navigating a form using the keyboard, selecting a value in an **Auto Complete** form field did not properly register the selection, leading to form submission failures.  
This has been fixed, values chosen through keyboard navigation are now correctly captured, ensuring successful form submission.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Fixed: Studio Inspection Panel Download & Navigation Issues</summary>

**Improvements in the Studio Inspection Panel:**

1. **Incorrect File Download Fixed**  
   Downloading inspection results from the **Download** button modified the data and generated an incorrect `.html` file.  
   It now downloads a **`.json` file** with accurate inspection data.

2. **File Navigation for Linted Files Outside `src` Fixed**  
   When linting files outside the `src` folder using the `eslintrc-override.js` configuration, clicking an issue in the Inspection Panel did not navigate to the correct file.  
   Navigation now works correctly for all linted files, including those outside `src`.

</details>

### React Native

<details>
<summary>Fixed: Scroll and Image Loading Issues in List Widget inside Tabs Widget</summary>

Resolved two issues with the **Tabs widget** when it contained a **List widget**:

- **Scroll Issue**: Tab content was not scrollable on first load.
- **Image Loading Issue**: Images inside the list sometimes failed to load within tab content.

Both issues have now been fixed. Tab content is scrollable on first load, and images load reliably.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Fixed: Marker Text Not Rendering in Slider Inside Form Widget</summary>

Resolved an issue where the **Marker Text** in the **Slider widget** was not displaying correctly when the slider was placed inside a **Form widget**.  
Marker text now renders as expected.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Fixed: Alignment Issue in Grid Widget Columns</summary>

Resolved an issue in the **Grid widget** where content inside multiple columns of a row was not aligning side by side as expected, and instead appeared stacked vertically.  
The columns now render their content correctly in a horizontal layout.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Fixed: Bottom Sheet Layout, Positioning, and Rendering Issues</summary>

Several critical issues with the **Bottom Sheet widget** have been addressed for a smoother and more consistent user experience:

- On **iOS & Android**, the Bottom Sheet now adjusts correctly when the **keyboard opens**, without pushing background content or overflowing out of view.
- On pages with a **List**, the Bottom Sheet now opens **as an overlay**, correctly appearing above the content instead of below it—no more unnecessary scrolling.
- When used inside a **Partial**, the Bottom Sheet now renders reliably without layout or visibility problems.

These improvements ensure the Bottom Sheet behaves consistently across layouts, platforms, and use cases.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Fixed: Duplicate API Calls and Missing Items in Infinite Scroll</summary>

Resolved an issue in the **List widget** where, with **Pagination Type** set to **"Infinite Scroll"**, scrolling sometimes triggered **duplicate API calls** or caused **missing list items**.  
The infinite scroll logic has now been stabilized to ensure smooth and consistent data loading on user scroll.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Fixed: Slider Thumb Position Not Updating via Script</summary>

Resolved an issue where updating the **`datavalue`** of the **Slider widget** via script correctly changed the value, but the **thumb position** did **not reflect the change visually**.  
The thumb now moves as expected when the value is updated using script.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Resolved accessibility issues in multiple widgets</summary>

Improved accessibility support for following widgets by fixing compatibility issues with screen readers and other accessibility tools.  
- Anchor
- Button
- Label
- Message
- Picture
- Video
- Barcode Scanner
- Camera
- Calendar
- Check-box
- Check-box set
- Chips
- Currency
- Date-time
- File Upload
- RadioSet
- Rating
- Select
- Switch
- Toggle
- Popover

These widgets now provide better support for assistive technologies, ensuring more accessible applications.

<details>
<summary>

### Known Issues

</summary>

- **Label, Anchor, Picture, Message, Search Widget** – Hint/role not working (iOS), repeated hints (iOS), selection issues.
- **Form Inputs (Text, Number, TextArea, Chips, Currency, Radioset)** – Accessibility labels & roles not reflecting in Android; iOS not reading roles/hints; wrong priority between hint & label.
- **Date/Time Widgets** – Role not working in Android (expected in some), hint not working in iOS.
- **Rating, Charts (Line, Column, Area, Pie, Bar, Donut, Bubble), Popover Widgets** – App crashes when TalkBack is enabled (Android); scrolling issues in iOS for charts.
- **Navigation (Nav, Dropdown Menu)** – Labels & roles missing in both platforms.

</details>

</details>

<details>
<summary>Fixed: Tap Event Not Bubbling from Video Widget on Android</summary>

On **Android**, when the **Video widget** had **Enable Controls** disabled, tap events were not bubbling up to the parent widget.  
As a result, the parent widget’s `On Tap` event did not trigger when users tapped on the video.

This issue has been resolved. Tap events now correctly propagate, allowing parent widgets to respond even when video controls are disabled.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Fixed: Incorrect Video Height with Edge-to-Edge and Auto-Hide Navbar Enabled</summary>

Resolved an issue where videos with height set in **percentage (%)** were not rendering with correct height when both **Edge-to-Edge** and **Auto-Hide Navbar** options were enabled.  
Videos now render with proper height as expected.
</details>

<details>
<summary>

Fixed: Improper Body Construction for Rest APIs with `Content-Type` set to `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
</summary>

Resolved an issue where **REST APIs** using the **`application/x-www-form-urlencoded`** `Content-Type` were not triggered correctly.  
This was due to the request **body being improperly constructed**, resulting in failed API calls.  
The request body is now correctly formed and sent, ensuring successful API execution.
