WaveMaker has released version 11.3.6, which includes new features in React Native, such as Multi-theme support, Touch events, Audio widget, RTL Layout, Multiple selections in the List widget, React Native feature enhancements, and other bug fixes.

## New Features - React Native

### Multi Theme Support

WaveMaker now offers multiple theme support in an application where you can now add and apply additional themes other than the default theme and switch between them. Learn more about [Multi-theme Support](/learn/react-native/theme/#multi-theme-support).

### Touch Events

- WaveMaker has introduced a `Long Tap` event for the widgets that already support `Tap` and `Double Tap` events. 

:::note

Widgets that currently support Long Tap events are, [Tile](/learn/app-development/widgets/container/tile/), [Container](/learn/app-development/widgets/container/), [Progress circle](/learn/app-development/widgets/basic/progress-circle/), [Progress bar](/learn/app-development/widgets/basic/progress-bar/), [Picture](/learn/app-development/widgets/basic/picture/), [Label](/learn/app-development/widgets/basic/label/), [Button](/learn/app-development/widgets/form-widgets/button/), and [Anchor](/learn/app-development/widgets/basic/anchor/).
:::

- In the List widget, WaveMaker now supports Touch events, including `Tap`, `Double Tap`, and `Long Tap`. 

### Accordion Widget

Now you can view the content in multiple Accordion panes at the same time while using the Accordion widget in WaveMaker. Learn more about [Accordion](/learn/app-development/widgets/container/accordion/).

### Multiple Selection in List

You can now select multiple items in a List by enabling the **Multiple Selection** property. `Selection Limit` and `Selection Limit Exceeded` events allow restricting the maximum number of list items that can be selected. Learn more about [Multiple Selection in List](/learn/app-development/widgets/datalive/list/behavior-settings/#multiselect).

### Audio Widget

Introducing the Audio widget in WaveMaker Studio allowing users to add audio files in an application. Learn more about [Audio Widget](/learn/app-development/widgets/basic/audio/).

### Right To Left Layout Support - beta

The Right to Left (RTL) layout for the RTL written languages is now supported in WaveMaker.

## Enhancements

- Support for empty placeholders in the Number and Currency widget.
- In the Slider widget, now users can add styles to the slider min and max values.
- Users can now use the `hide-context-menu` class to avoid options like cut, copy, and paste getting displayed on `Tap` events.

## Expo Version Upgrade
