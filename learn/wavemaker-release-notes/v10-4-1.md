*WaveMaker released a new update version with bug fixes.*

## Bug fixes

---

### Widgets

#### Data Table

- For Data table with Live form, when you specify a date pattern that is not present in the dropdown, a validation error is thrown. Bug fixed.
- For a Data table configured with inline edit and with no row actions, there was no actionable to click on while creating new row. This is now fixed.
- If a Data table or Form widget is configured with Imported swagger's CRUD variable then in Form widget advanced settings dialog duplicate fields are shown.

#### Carousel

- Carousel does not display when the height of the widget is set to "%" when you preview. Bug fixed.

#### Checkboxset

- Checkboxset checked values do not remain checked after resetting the datavalue from JS. This is fixed.

#### List

- In List Widget "No Data Found" message is pushed to the bottom when you set a height. This is fixed.

#### File Upload

- For file upload widget, drag and drop option for multiple files are now enabled in WM 10. Messages are localized. UX built for when a folder is dropped for upload.

#### Switch

- Datavalues change when clicking widget even if it is disabled. This is now fixed.

#### Popover

- Issues with popover positioning in different scenarios.

### Notification Action

- When you confirm an action of the **onOk** event, if another confirm action gets invoked, then the second action would not work. This is now fixed.

### REST Services

- Fixed an issue of out of memory error when you test a REST service with a large response body.

### Localization

- **Time Widget**: For localization, when time widget format is set to 12 hr then entered time value is shown as invalid in some languages. This is fixed.
- **Date/Time display formats**: On changing locale, in preview mode selected date/time values show up in English format but in deployment(angular prod) values show up in selected language format. This is fixed.

### Trial Users

- Unable to open starter apps in WaveMaker Studio. This is now fixed.
- When you try to deploy the app, you see deploy dialog and then the error dialog. Bug fixed.

### Mobile

- Invoking PUT calls from mobile device throws an Invalid CORS request error. This is fixed.

### Other Issues

- Not navigating to the redirect page after login in angular build. This is now fixed.
- In the Manage Deployed Apps section, the last updated dates of the logs doesn't match with the date inside the log files. Bug fixed.
