WaveMaker's Release 11.11.6 introduces global error handling in mobile apps to prevent crashes, styling enhancements in React Native, and delivers several bug fixes across web and mobile platforms.

## Features

### React Native

<details>

<summary>Introduced global error handling for render failures in mobile apps</summary>

To improve mobile app stability, a **global error handling mechanism** has been added to catch unhandled **render errors**.

If a render failure occurs, instead of crashing, the app now displays a fallback screen showing the error message and provides the following options:

- **Go to Home**: Navigate back to the home screen  
- **Go Back**: Return to the previous screen

This prevents app crashes and ensures a more graceful recovery from rendering issues.

<img src={errorBoundary} alt="Error Fallback Screen" style={{maxWidth:'300px', width:'100%'}}/>

</details>

## Enhancements

### React Native

<details>
<summary>Added horizontal layout support for Form fields in Form widget</summary>

The **Form** widget now includes a new **Layout Position** property in its properties panel, allowing developers to control the alignment of field labels and input fields.

- **Vertical** (default): Label appears above the input field.
- **Horizontal**: Label and input field are aligned side by side.

This enhancement enables more flexible and space-efficient form layouts based on your design needs.
</details>

<details>
<summary>

Introduced `.app-list-content-container` class for List widget
</summary>

A new CSS class `.app-list-content-container` has been added to the **List widget**.  
This class targets the container that contains all the list items inside the list widget.

It can be used to apply consistent styling (e.g., padding, background, layout behavior) to the entire list content block.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Added CSS class to target individual panes in Accordion widget</summary>

A new CSS class **`.app-accordion-pane`** has been introduced to allow styling of **individual accordion panes** within the **Accordion** widget.

This enables custom styling like assigning different border colors or backgrounds for each pane.  

Example:
```css
.app-accordion-pane {
  border-left: 4px solid red;
}
```
</details>

## Bugs

### Web

<details>
<summary>

Fixed issue with form submission using `enter key`

</summary>

Resolved an issue where pressing `enter` inside form fields did not trigger form submission when a Chips widget was present.

Form submission via the `Enter` key now works as expected.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Fixed multiple pagination issues in List widget</summary>

Several pagination-related bugs in the **List** widget have been addressed:

1. In Studio when the **Page Size** property was cleared, it was getting auto-populated with a default value on navigating between tabs or refreshing, this has been fixed.

2. Pagination is was showing even when list had only one page, this has been fixed now. Pagination will only be shown if list has more than one page.

3. Pagination was only showing first page, this has been fixed now. Pagination now correctly showsw all pages available in list as expected.

</details>

### React Native

<details>
<summary>Fixed Dialog height issue on orientation change</summary>

Resolved an issue where the **Dialog** widget height was not adjusting correctly when the device orientation changed between **portrait** and **landscape** modes. 

Dialogs now resize properly to fit the screen after orientation changes, ensuring consistent layout and usability.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Fixed text overflow issue in Label widget on Android</summary>

When the **Label** widget had `wrap` set to `false` and **Number of Lines** set to `1`, long text content was expected to truncate with an ellipsis if it exceeded the available width.

This behavior was working correctly on **Web Preview** and **iOS**, but on **Android**, the text was overflowing the screen.  
This has now been fixed — text truncates with an ellipsis on Android as expected.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Fixed issues related to Slider widget</summary>

This update addresses multiple issues in the **Slider widget**:

1. **Tooltip and Data Value Mismatch**  
   - The displayed tooltip value was not always in sync with the widget’s actual `datavalue`. This mismatch has now been corrected.

2. **Large Range Handling Issues** (e.g., **Min: 100**, **Max: 100000**)
   - On iOS, navigating to the page with slider was causing app crash.  
   - The slider was allowing values outside the defined range, and the tooltip was not rendering correctly for large numbers (3–4 digits). Tooltip alignment has also been corrected.
