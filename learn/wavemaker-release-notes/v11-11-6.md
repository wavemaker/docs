WaveMaker's Release 11.11.6 introduces global error handling in mobile apps to prevent crashes, new React Native enhancements, and delivers several bug fixes across web and mobile app.

## Features

### React Native

<details>

<summary>Introduced global error handling for render failures in mobile apps</summary>

To improve mobile app stability, a global error handling mechanism has been added to catch unhandled render errors.

If a render failure occurs, instead of crashing, the app now displays a fallback screen showing the error message and provides the following options:

- Go to Home: Navigate back to the home screen  
- Go Back: Return to the previous screen

This prevents app crashes and ensures a more graceful recovery from rendering issues.

<img src={errorBoundary} alt="Error Fallback Screen" style={{maxWidth:'300px', width:'100%'}}/>

</details>

## Enhancements

### React Native

<details>
<summary>Added CSS class to target individual panes in Accordion widget</summary>

A new CSS class `.app-accordion-pane` has been introduced to allow styling of individual accordion panes within the Accordion widget.

This enables custom styling like assigning different border colors or backgrounds for each pane.  

Example:
```css
.app-accordion-pane {
  border-left: 4px solid red;
}
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Added support for ellipsis handling in Label widget on Android</summary>

On Android, when the Label widget had wrap is false and Number of Lines = 1, long text was not truncating with an ellipsis, unlike on Web Preview and iOS.

To address this, a new property **Enable Android Ellipsis** has been added to the Label widget’s properties panel.  
When enabled, it ensures that long text is truncated with an ellipsis on Android as expected.

:::note
Enabling **Enable Android Ellipsis** disables rich text formatting (e.g., bold, links) on Android.  
By default, this property is set to false.
:::
</details>

<details>
<summary>Added control to prevent onChange trigger from script updates in Form fields</summary>

Previously, when the `datavalue` of a Form field was updated via script, the onChange event callback would also get triggered automatically.

To give developers more control, a new property **Skip on change event from script** has been added to the form field’s properties panel.

When enabled, the onChange callback will only trigger when the user updates the value from the UI, and not when it's updated through scripts.

:::note
This property is disabled by default, so existing behavior remains unchanged unless explicitly modified.

## Bugs

### Web

<details>
<summary>Fixed chart loading issue in prefabs used within Tab widget</summary>

Resolved an issue where Chart widgets inside a Prefab failed to render properly when the Prefab was placed inside multiple tabs of a Tab widget.  
Charts loaded fine in the first tab, but remained stuck on loading when switching to other tabs. This behavior has now been fixed, charts render correctly across all tabs.

<summary>

Fixed issue with form submission using `enter key`

</summary>

Resolved an issue where pressing `enter` inside form fields did not trigger form submission when a Chips widget was present.

Form submission via the `Enter` key now works as expected.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Fixed multiple pagination issues in List widget</summary>

Several pagination-related bugs in the List widget have been addressed:

1. In Studio when the Page Size property was cleared, it was getting auto-populated with a default value on navigating between tabs or refreshing, this has been fixed.

2. Pagination is was showing even when list had only one page, this has been fixed now. Pagination will only be shown if list has more than one page.

3. Pagination was only showing first page, this has been fixed now. Pagination now correctly showsw all pages available in list as expected.
