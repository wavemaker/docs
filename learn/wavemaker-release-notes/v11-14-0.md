WaveMaker 11.14.0 comes with major upgrade for React Native platform SDK. It is now upgraded to Expo 54 & React Native 0.81.4, delivering newer APIs, better build reliability, improved security, and runtime performance. This release also includes several tech-stack updates, Studio & React Native enhancements, and several bug fixes across Web and React Native.

## Features

## Web

<details> 
<summary>Design System</summary>

Introducing the new **Design System**, a foundational part of WaveMaker’s enhanced styling experience for maintaining a consistent visual theme across all components within your application.

The Design System defines reusable **design tokens**, such as colors, typography, spacing, radius, and shadows that serve as the building blocks of your app’s design.

It is a practical, visual environment, enabling teams to connect design and development seamlessly.  
By managing styles through tokens, you can now:  
- Maintain a unified look and feel across pages and components.  
- Apply brand updates instantly without manual edits.  
- Preview and confirm design changes before applying them globally.  

To learn more, see the [Design System Overview](/learn/design-system/overview) documentation page to explore how design tokens and the Style Workspace help you build cohesive, scalable UI themes.

<details> 
<summary>Auto Layout Features in Container widget</summary>

The Container widget now includes powerful layout properties that simplify how you structure and align elements in your app. These properties provide automatic management of spacing, alignment, and resizing of child elements.

Using these layout properties, developers can create responsive, adaptive, and neatly structured UI layouts without relying on manual margin or padding adjustments. This is especially useful for building form sections, cards, lists, toolbars, and dashboard layouts that must adapt smoothly to various screen sizes and dynamic data.

### Key benefits include:

- **Responsive alignment and spacing**: Components automatically adjust their position and spacing based on layout.
- **Dynamic sizing**: Elements can grow, shrink, or “hug” content dynamically for precise layout control.
- **Simplified design workflow**: Layout management becomes more visual and intuitive in Studio.
- **Consistent layouts**: Ensures design uniformity across complex UI hierarchies.

Overall, Auto Layout makes building flexible and visually consistent web app interfaces faster and more efficient.

_Layout Properties in Studio_

### Layout Properties

| Property     | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| Direction     | Defines the primary axis for child elements, horizontal (row) or vertical (column). |
| Wrap          | Enables wrapping when children overflow the container. |
| Width         | Determines container width — 'fill' takes all available space, 'hug' adapts to children, or set any explicit value. |
| Height        | Determines container height — fill' takes all available space, 'hug' adapts to children, or set any explicit value. |
| Alignment     | Controls alignment of child elements both horizontally and vertically. |
| Gap           | Defines spacing between child elements. 'auto' distributes space dynamically. |
| Column Gap    | Works when wrap is true, defines spacing between columns. |
| Padding       | Sets container padding. |

:::note
Auto Layout features are only available in Web Apps using **Design System**.

## Enhancements

## Studio

<details>
<summary>Support for Hyphens in Project Names</summary>

Studio now allows hyphens (`-`) in project names when creating new projects, giving developers more flexibility in how they name their projects. For example, names like `my-app` or `demo-project` are now supported.
</details>

## React Native

<details>
<summary>

React Native Apps SDK Upgraded to **Expo 54**, **React Native 0.81.4**
</summary>

The React Native Apps SDK has been upgraded to **Expo 54**, which uses **React Native 0.81.4**. This update enhances app stability and performance while bringing all the latest features and improvements from Expo 54 and React Native 0.81.4.

- This upgrade ships with Android 16KB page support, ensuring compatibility with newer Android devices running API level 36 and above.

:::note

- The `elevate` and `boxShadow` style properties are no longer supported. Use `box-shadow` to achieve the same styling effects.
- **Navigation Bar Style** property is being deprecated. With this upgrade we are targeting Android API 36.0.0, which doesn't support manual navigation bar styling, as the system now handles navigation bar appearance automatically.

:::

:::warning
Please ensure that all external packages used in your project are compatible with Expo 54.
:::

</details>

<details>
<summary>Accordion Icon Customization</summary>

Added two new properties **Expanded Icon Class** and **Collapsed Icon Class** to the Accordion widget. These properties allow developers to easily customize the icons displayed for expanded and collapsed panes, enhancing the visual control and flexibility of the widget.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Bottom Sheet Enhancements</summary>

The Bottom Sheet widget has been enhanced with a new property and callback events to provide better control and interaction handling:

1. **Content Scrolling Control**
   - A new **Disable Scroll on Rest** property gives developers finer control over scrolling behavior
   - When enabled, it prevents content inside the Bottom Sheet from scrolling when Bottom Sheet is in collapsed (rest) state
   - By default, this property is disabled, allowing normal scrolling within Bottom Sheet

2. **Callback Events**
   - **onExpand**: Triggered when the Bottom Sheet is expanded.
   - **onCollapse**: Triggered when the Bottom Sheet is collapsed.

These enhancements allow developers to create more responsive and interactive Bottom Sheet implementations with better control over content behavior and user interactions.
</details>

<details>
<summary>

Improved List Navigation with **Horizontal Scroll to Item**
</summary>

The List widget now includes a new property **Horizontal Scroll to Item**, that enhances navigation within horizontally scrollable lists.  

When enabled, selecting an item smoothly scrolls it into the center of the view for better visibility. When disabled, the list remains in its current position without automatic scrolling.  

This property is _enabled by default_.

</details>

<details>
<summary>WavePulse Enabled by Default for Web Preview</summary>

**WavePulse** is now enabled by default for web previews, allowing developers to inspect and debug application without additional setup.
</details>

## Bugs

### Web

<details>
<summary>Switch Widget Default Selection Fix</summary>
When a Switch widget has no default selection and no selection is made, `datavalue` will no longer return the first option automatically. It now correctly remains empty until a selection is made as there is no default value.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Persist Selection in Data Table on Dataset Update</summary>
Selected rows in a Data Table of modal variable now persist correctly when the dataset is updated via script or when navigating between pages. Previously, selections could be lost after modifying a row or changing pagination, but selections are now maintained consistently.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Classic Pagination Fix for Data Tables</summary>
Fixed an issue in Classic Pagination for Data Tables where entering an invalid page number did not refresh the table data correctly. Now, if a user enters a page number outside the valid range (too high or zero), the table navigates to the appropriate page and displays the correct records.
</details>

### React Native

<details>
<summary>Fixed Application of Custom Plugins</summary>

Resolved an issue where custom plugins added in `project/src/main/webapp/app.json` were not applied correctly, sometimes causing crashes during preview. Plugins now apply properly, ensuring a stable and reliable app.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Device Orientation Fix</summary>

Fixed an issue where the **Device Orientation** configuration was not being applied, causing the app to remain locked in **Portrait mode** regardless of the developer’s configuration. The orientation settings now work correctly as configured.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Web Preview Bug Fixes & Enhancements</summary>
Several issues in Web Preview have been addressed to improve stability and user experience:  

1. Fixed errors in the browser console that appeared when **WavePulse** was opened.  
2. Resolved UI inconsistencies, making Web Preview more reliable and visually consistent.  
3. Enhanced the **Clean Preview** feature for more dependable fresh previews. 
4. Fixed an issue where few build errors were not shown in the progress loader in certain edge cases. These errors are now properly shown.
5. Added an intermediate loading screen, to replace the brief white screen between the progress loader and app render, ensuring smoother transitions while app bundle and assets are being downloaded.

<details>
<summary> 

**File** Device Variable Fix
</summary>

Fixed an issue where the app could crash when using the **File** Device Variable. The variable now works correctly without causing crashes.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Fixed Inconsistent Column Width in Vertical Lists</summary>
Fixed an issue in vertical lists where rows with fewer items than the specified number of columns were incorrectly resizing. Previously, items in such rows were expanding to fill the full row width instead of maintaining the intended column width. Now, all items correctly take up the width corresponding to their column, ensuring consistent alignment across all rows.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexWrap: 'wrap', gap: '10px' }}>
  <figure style={{ textAlign: 'center', margin: 0 }}>
    <img src={incorrectColumnWidtBefore} alt="Incorrect Column Width Before" style={{ maxWidth: 320, width: '100%' }} />
    <figcaption>Before</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <figure style={{ textAlign: 'center', margin: 0 }}>
    <img src={incorrectColumnWidthAfter} alt="Incorrect Column Width After" style={{ maxWidth: 320, width: '100%' }} />
    <figcaption>After</figcaption>
  </figure>
