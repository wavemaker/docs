## Enhancements

## React Native

<details>
<summary>Accordion Icon Customization</summary>

Added two new properties **Expanded Icon Class** and **Collapsed Icon Class** to the Accordion widget. These properties allow developers to easily customize the icons displayed for expanded and collapsed panes, enhancing the visual control and flexibility of the widget.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Bottom Sheet Enhancements</summary>

The Bottom Sheet widget has been enhanced with a new property and callback events to provide better control and interaction handling:

1. **Content Scrolling Control**
   - A new **Disable Scroll on Rest** property gives developers finer control over scrolling behavior
   - When enabled, it prevents content inside the Bottom Sheet from scrolling when Bottom Sheet is in collapsed (rest) state
   - By default, this property is disabled, allowing normal scrolling within Bottom Sheet

2. **Callback Events**
   - **onExpand**: Triggered when the Bottom Sheet is expanded.
   - **onCollapse**: Triggered when the Bottom Sheet is collapsed.

These enhancements allow developers to create more responsive and interactive Bottom Sheet implementations with better control over content behavior and user interactions.
</details>

<details>
<summary>

Improved List Navigation with **Horizontal Scroll to Item**
</summary>

The List widget now includes a new property **Horizontal Scroll to Item**, that enhances navigation within horizontally scrollable lists.  

When enabled, selecting an item smoothly scrolls it into the center of the view for better visibility. When disabled, the list remains in its current position without automatic scrolling.  

This property is _enabled by default_.

</details>

<details>
<summary>WavePulse Enabled by Default for Web Preview</summary>

**WavePulse** is now enabled by default for web previews, allowing developers to inspect and debug application without additional setup.
</details>

## Bugs

### Web

<details>
<summary>Switch Widget Default Selection Fix</summary>
When a Switch widget has no default selection and no selection is made, `datavalue` will no longer return the first option automatically. It now correctly remains empty until a selection is made as there is no default value.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Persist Selection in Data Table on Dataset Update</summary>
Selected rows in a Data Table of modal variable now persist correctly when the dataset is updated via script or when navigating between pages. Previously, selections could be lost after modifying a row or changing pagination, but selections are now maintained consistently.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Classic Pagination Fix for Data Tables</summary>
Fixed an issue in Classic Pagination for Data Tables where entering an invalid page number did not refresh the table data correctly. Now, if a user enters a page number outside the valid range (too high or zero), the table navigates to the appropriate page and displays the correct records.
</details>

### React Native

<details>
<summary>Fixed Application of Custom Plugins</summary>

Resolved an issue where custom plugins added in `project/src/main/webapp/app.json` were not applied correctly, sometimes causing crashes during preview. Plugins now apply properly, ensuring a stable and reliable app.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Device Orientation Fix</summary>

Fixed an issue where the **Device Orientation** configuration was not being applied, causing the app to remain locked in **Portrait mode** regardless of the developerâ€™s configuration. The orientation settings now work correctly as configured.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Web Preview Bug Fixes & Enhancements</summary>
Several issues in Web Preview have been addressed to improve stability and user experience:  

1. Fixed errors in the browser console that appeared when **WavePulse** was opened.  
2. Resolved UI inconsistencies, making Web Preview more reliable and visually consistent.  
3. Enhanced the **Clean Preview** feature for more dependable fresh previews. 
4. Fixed an issue where few build errors were not shown in the progress loader in certain edge cases. These errors are now properly shown.
5. Added an intermediate loading screen, to replace the brief white screen between the progress loader and app render, ensuring smoother transitions while app bundle and assets are being downloaded.
