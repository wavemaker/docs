## Enhancements

### Web

<details>
<summary>

Support for `ng serve` in Web Apps

</summary>

WaveMaker web apps can now be run and debugged locally using `ng serve`, just like standard Angular applications. This makes it easier for developers to test, debug, and extend their apps outside of Studio by running the frontend independently and connecting it to backend services via a proxy configuration.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Improved Calendar widget date range handling</summary>
In Calendar widget, months and years outside the defined minimum and maximum date range are now not only greyed out but also show a block icon (üö´) cursor on hover. This provides clearer feedback to users when attempting to select unavailable options.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Customizable AM/PM labels in Date/Datetime widget</summary>

The Date and Datetime widgets now support customizable AM/PM labels. Developers can override the default text by adding `LABEL_AM` and `LABEL_PM` entries in Localized Messages (i18n). Once defined, these labels will be applied in the Time and Datetime widgets to match project requirements.
</details>

### Studio

<details>
<summary>Improved inspection panel refresh flow</summary>
The inspection panel now provides clear feedback while results are being refreshed. When a refresh is triggered, the Refresh and Download buttons are disabled until the process completes, and a loading indicator (‚ÄúInspection in progress‚Ä¶‚Äù) is displayed. Once results are updated, the buttons are re-enabled and a notification confirms the update. This prevents repeated clicks, avoids confusion with old results, and ensures a smoother inspection experience.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Removed Document API Warning in Prefabs</summary>

The warning about using the `document` API in prefab scripts has been removed. Developers can now use the API without seeing unnecessary warnings.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Alphanumeric Support for OpenID Provider ID</summary>

OpenID provider IDs now support alphanumeric values, allowing identifiers such as _IDP1_, _IDP2_, etc. This enhancement makes it easier to manage multiple OpenID providers with clear and flexible naming.
</details>

|-------------------------|---------------------------------------|

These upgrades make Studio Preview more developer friendly, helping you easily build, test, and debug your apps.

<details>
<summary>Support for disabling screen capture</summary>
A new option is available to protect sensitive data by preventing screenshots in apps. When enabled, this feature blocks both direct screenshots and cached screenshots that appear in the recent apps screen.  

To enable, add the following in **wm_rn_config.json**:  

```json
"screenCaptureProtection": {
  "enabled": true
}
```

> Note: This requires a development build and may not work in Expo Go.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Secure Storage Service</summary>

Introducing `SecureStorageService`, a newly added service in WaveMaker React Native, to store sensitive data such as authentication tokens, passwords, or API keys in an encrypted way. This service leverages platform-specific secure storage (via Expo Secure Store), so developers no longer need to manually import or configure libraries.  

Example usage:  
```ts
App.getDependency("SecureStorageService").setItem("authToken", "JCytZU2QTzJnNIpzuUjtABxC");
```

**Supported methods:**

| Method                | Description                                          |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `getItem(key)`       | Retrieves a securely stored value for the given key. |
| `setItem(key, value)` | Stores the value securely under the given key.       |
| `removeItem(key)`     | Removes a securely stored value.                     |

> Note : SecureStorageService supports a maximum of 4KB per key and is not intended for large datasets.
