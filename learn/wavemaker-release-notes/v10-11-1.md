:::

- Fixed an issue related to the Dirty property in Live Form, displaying `true` even when you do not make any changes in the Liveform preview.


### Data Table

- Fixed an issue related to the multicolumn filter in Data Table for sorting dates that are not aligned correctly for Default Theme.
- Fixed an issue related to the columns' width of the table widget inside the tabs widget. When loading the page, the table rendered inside an inactive tab does not correctly reflect when selecting it.
- Changed the default search behavior of Tables. When no column is selected in the search filter dropdown, the search triggers across all the displayed columns.
