|---|---|---|

### Improvements on Charts

- Bug fix on tooltip appearing in the corner in mobile apps.
- Support for changing the position of legends on the chart to top, bottom, right. Earlier only top, bottom were supported.


### Optimizing the sign up flow

- New users can access the product right after sign up without verifying the email.
- During the time when the email is unverified, adding new users to the project, deploy, exporting the project, push to external git will be disabled.
- During the trial period importing a project into WaveMaker will be disabled.

### WKWebView is integrated

Apple made it mandatory for all new apps to use WKWebView instead of UIWebView. So, Wavemaker is updated to use WKWebView. For more information, see our [blog on WKWebView](/learn/blog/2020/04/20/wavemaker-wkwebview-upgrade).


### iOS Upgrade

- iOS apps that use old webview are getting rejected by Apple. In cordova-ios 5.1.1, old webview references were completely removed. So, Wavemaker platform is upgraded to cordova-ios@5.1.1. 
- Wavemaker supported plugins are also updated. 
- Phonegap build does not support cordova-ios@5.1.1 version, yet. Therefore, manual build is necessary for all new app submissions to the App store.

## Bug fixes

---

- Show errors like a deleted prefab, wrong font reference in CSS before deploy process instead of showing deployment failure after a long wait. [#doc](/learn/app-development/dev-integration/inspection-framework#no-missing-page-elements)
- InLine edit of Table should support the same form validation methods that are supported on the form. [#doc](/learn/app-development/widgets/datalive/field-validator)
- Pulling from VCS sometimes would cause the project to become unresponsive.
- In design dialog for a text widget of type number, when you give a number and click the enter key, you see a console error "ERROR TypeError: Cannot read property 'dataoutput' of undefined. This is not fixed. 
- On `Page.OnReady`, Variables with "Request data on page Load" were not invoked in Angular Build. This is not fixed.
- Liveform submit fails with an error "Process rejected in the queue, check the inflight behavior" when click **Save** multiple times on a slow network, which inserts multiple blank records instead of one. This is fixed.
-  The dropdown was not visible for autocomplete widgets when they were inside the livefilter, and when the displaylabel attribute is present on the wm-filterfield. This is now fixed. 
- When on selecting an item from the list, the data table (added row expansion feature) will be filtered based on the selected list item. However, when row is expanded and later selecting list item throws error and data is not loaded in data table.
- Cannot use `$i` to loop through the Variable while specifying the "IN" filter condition.
- Exposed a property for clicking outside the popover widget to not close when still working on it.
- Build in phonegap fails when the cordova is huge. This is fixed.


## Deprecation

---

- Platform support for Mobile Apps on Android Kitkat is deprecated and is going to end in Wavemaker 10.5.
