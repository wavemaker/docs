WaveMaker 11.14.2 enhances Wizard widget in React Native and delivers several Studio and React Native bug fixes.

## Enhancements

### React Native

<details>
<summary>Customize the Done Button Icon in Wizard Widget</summary>

A new **Done Icon** property has been added to the Wizard widget, allowing developers to customize the icon displayed on the wizard’s *Done* button.
</details>

:::caution This release may impact existing projects.
In WaveMaker 11.14.0, we introduced the Design System, which powers capabilities like Style Workspace and Auto Layout for Web projects. While these features are currently available only for Web, we are actively working on bringing them to mobile projects in an upcoming release. This update includes foundational changes needed to enable that future support. Because these updates involve runtime changes at the component level, they may affect existing projects.

Although we have conducted extensive testing across all components and multiple internal applications, your existing apps may still behave differently. **We strongly recommend validating your projects in a staging environment before upgrading**.

## Bugs

### Studio

<details>
<summary>Saving Prefab Deployment Settings in a Project Now Works Correctly</summary>

Resolved an issue where updates made under **Settings → Profile Configuration → Deployment Profile → Prefab** were not being saved. Changes to a Prefab's deployment configuration in a project now save correctly when the user clicks Save.
</details>

### React Native

<details>
<summary>Fixed Moment Returning Incorrect Locale in Scripts</summary>

Resolved an issue where the **Moment** library returned an incorrect locale when accessed in scripts. The `moment.locale()` call now correctly returns the currently selected locale.
</details>

<details>
<summary>

Fixed `undefined` Step Index value in Wizard Step **On Load** Event
</summary>

Resolved an issue in Wizard widgets where the JavaScript **On Load** event for a step received `stepIndex` as `undefined`. The event now correctly provides the `stepIndex` value corresponding to the loaded step.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Improved Element Detection for Text and Radio Set Widgets on iOS</summary>

Fixed an issue where **Text** and **Radio Set** widgets were not detectable in Appium Inspector on iOS devices, while working correctly on Android. These widgets are now properly exposed for inspection and automation on iOS.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Fixed Transparent Color Issue on Android After Expo 54 Upgrade</summary>

In WaveMaker 11.14.1, the Expo 54 upgrade introduced a React Native issue where `color: transparent` did not work correctly on **Android** devices. This has now been fixed, and transparent colors render properly again.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Fixed Incorrect Menu Positioning</summary>
Menu widgets in React Native were previously calculating their position only during the initial page render. As a result, if the menu button moved, such as when placed inside a scrollable list, the menu opened at the old position. This has now been fixed, and the menu reliably opens at the button's current location.
