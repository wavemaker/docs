WaveMaker 11.14.1 introduces enhanced commit message control and support for hyphenated page & partial names in Studio, giving developers more flexibility. It also includes a bug fix for stacked charts in web projects.

## Enhancements

### Studio

<details>
<summary>Added Control for Commit Message Details</summary>
When committing and pushing code changes in the Studio, the system automatically appends a detailed list of all modified, added, or deleted files to every commit message.  

A new property **Changes Description Enabled** has now been introduced in **Team Portal → Code Repository** to control this behavior.
- When enabled, commit messages continue to include the detailed list of changed files.
- When disabled, only the developer’s commit message is included, allowing for cleaner, more concise commit history.   

**Example:**  
- **Enabled:** commit message includes file list.

- **Disabled:** commit message includes only the developer written message.

</details>


<details>
<summary>Support for Hyphens in Page and Partial Names</summary>

Studio now supports using hyphens (`-`) in **page** and **partial** names, giving developers greater flexibility when naming pages and partials in their projects. For example, names like `user-profile` or `settings-page` are now valid.
</details>

## Bugs

### Web

<details>
<summary>Fixed Axis Label Issue in Stacked Bar Charts</summary>

Resolved an issue where the x-axis of stacked bar charts displayed integer values instead of the expected string labels. The chart now correctly renders the bound string values on the x-axis in Stacked Bar Charts.
