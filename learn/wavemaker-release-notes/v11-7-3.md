This release includes performance improvements, and some bug fixes.

### Date Widget Enhancements

- **Date Entry**: Define a specific format (e.g., MM/DD/YYYY) for user input in the Date Widget. This ensures consistency and eliminates confusion when entering dates. This enforcement is a flag based option through the properties panel.

:::note 
**Locale Settings**: The displayed date format will adapt based on your chosen locale. However, the enforced entry format will take priority, ensuring consistent user input regardless of locale.

### Performance Improvements

- Dialogs now load their content only when you click them to open. This helps web pages with many complex dialogs load faster.
- Bind Dialog and Tab Loading: Tabs in the bind dialog now load only when needed, improving navigation speed and overall performance.
- Web pages with many dialogs, containing a lot of Widgets and Prefabs will now load and perform better with lazy loading; dialog content only loads when the dialog is clicked.
- Prefabs load faster; reducing the number of calls needed to access properties and configuration files. 
- Optimized Angular builds to reduce the size of the generated application files (like vendor.js and main.js); the studio loads noticeably faster.

## Bug Fixes


### React Native

- Fixed an issue where the user was unable to view the Toaster message even when the input record was successfully saved.
- Fixed an issue where the Live form event parameters were not returning the required data.
- Fixed an issue related to the Form widget where the input data was not getting bound to the created variable dataset during the submission.
- Fixed an issue where the input record is not getting saved in the database while using database CRUD variables. No network call is getting triggered on clicking the Save button.
- Fixed an issue with the Live Form widget where user was unable to save any form field input data and view any changes even after saving the data.

### Studio Fixes

- Fixed Radio button selection; only one radio button can be selected at a time, as intended.
- Fixed an issue where Bind Dialog tabs wouldn't render if no dataset was provided; tabs display as expected, regardless of the data availability.
- Data widgets now display all available endpoints during configuration for imported APIs; ensures a complete view of your API's functionality.
- Fixed an issue with database deletion preventing the single imported database in the API workspace; delete a solo database with the expected results.

#### Navbar

- Fixed an issue with Menu in Navbar related to Submenu opening direction. The submenu of a Menu widget placed inside a navbar would initially open upwards on the first click and then downwards on subsequent clicks.
- Fixed a transparency issue with the background of expanded child menus, ensuring better readability of the submenu content.
