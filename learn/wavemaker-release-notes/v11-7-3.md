### Date Widget Enhancements

**Date Entry**: You can now enforce a specific format (e.g., MM/DD/YYYY) for user input in the Date Widget. This ensures consistency and eliminates confusion when entering dates.
**Locale Settings**: The displayed date format will adapt based on your chosen locale. However, the enforced entry format will take priority, ensuring consistent user input regardless of locale.


## Performance Improvements

- Dialogs now load their content only when you click them to open. This helps web pages with many complex dialogs load faster.
- Bind Dialog and Tab Loading: Tabs in the bind dialog now load only when needed, improving navigation speed and overall performance.
- Web pages with many dialogs, containing a lot of Widgets and Prefabs will now load and perform better with lazy loading; dialog content only loads when the dialog is clicked.
- Prefabs load faster; reducing the number of calls needed to access properties and configuration files. 
- optimized Angular builds to reduce the size of the generated application files (like vendor.js and main.js); the studio loads noticeably faster.
