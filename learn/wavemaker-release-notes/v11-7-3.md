### Date Widget Enhancements

**Date Entry**: You can now enforce a specific format (e.g., MM/DD/YYYY) for user input in the Date Widget. This ensures consistency and eliminates confusion when entering dates.
**Locale Settings**: The displayed date format will adapt based on your chosen locale. However, the enforced entry format will take priority, ensuring consistent user input regardless of locale.


## Performance Improvements

- Improved Dialog Performance: Dialogs now load their content only when you click them to open. This helps web pages with many complex dialogs load faster.
