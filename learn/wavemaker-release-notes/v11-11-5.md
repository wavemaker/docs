## Features

### React Native

<details>
<summary>New Edge-to-Edge App Experience with hideable Top & Bottom Nav</summary>

We’ve introduced a powerful new feature set to help you build **modern, immersive edge-to-edge mobile apps**. These capabilities are now configurable directly from Studio, providing a seamless developer experience.

#### Features Overview

#### Edge-to-Edge Apps
Enable full-screen UI experiences by extending app content beneath:
- The **Status Bar**
- The **Navigation Bar** (Android) / **Home Bar** (iOS)
- **Device-specific cutouts** like notches or camera holes

This enhances immersion and allows your app to utilize **100% of screen real estate**.

#### Auto-Hide Navbars
Automatically hides the **Navigation Bar** and **Tab Bar** when users scroll down — giving content more room to breathe. As users scroll up, these bars **reappear** with a smooth transition.

<div
  style={{
    display: 'flex',
    flexWrap: 'wrap',
    gap: 16,
    justifyContent: 'center',
  }}
>
  <div style={{ flex: '1 1 300px', maxWidth: 400 }}>
    <video style={{ width: '100%' }} controls>
      <source src={e2edemo} />
    </video>
    <p style={{ textAlign: 'center', marginTop: 8 }}>Edge-to-Edge App</p>
  </div>

  <div style={{ flex: '1 1 300px', maxWidth: 400 }}>
    <video style={{ width: '100%' }} controls>
      <source src={e2ehidingbardemo} />
    </video>
    <p style={{ textAlign: 'center', marginTop: 8 }}>
      Edge-to-Edge App with Auto Hide Top & Bottom Nav
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

#### Benefits
- More usable screen space for content
- Modern visual behavior, consistent with native apps
- Enhanced user engagement and usability

These enhancements collectively aim to bring your app experience on par with modern design guidelines seen in popular native apps.

<details>
<summary>New Widget - Bottom Sheet</summary>

A new widget **Bottom Sheet** has been added for mobile apps. It provides a panel that slides up from the bottom of the screen to present additional content or actions — without navigating away from the current screen.

**Key Features:**

- **Tap Outside to Close**: Dismisses automatically when tapping outside the panel.
- **Swipe Down to Dismiss**: Allows intuitive gesture-based closing.
- **Swipe Up to Expand**: Expands to a configured height with an upward swipe.
- **Smooth Animations**: Provides fluid open/close transitions for a seamless user experience.

Bottom sheets are ideal for use cases like filters, media controls, map detail views, and quick user actions.

## Enhancements

### Web

<details>
<summary>Accessibility Enhancement: “Skip to Main Content” support</summary>

Added support for the **Skip to Main Content** accessibility feature.  
Users navigating via keyboard or assistive technologies can now bypass repetitive layout elements and jump directly to the main page content.

![Skip To Main Content](/learn/assets/release-notes/skipToMain-11-11-5.png)

It can be configured in Settings -> General -> `Enable Skip to Main Content`.

![Skip To Main Content Config](/learn/assets/release-notes/skipToMain-config-11-11-5.png)
</details>

<details>
<summary>Enhanced Data Table footer with additional page size options</summary>

The Data Table widget footer has been enhanced to provide users with more control over pagination:

- **Items per Page**: Displays the selected page size (e.g., "5 items per page").
- **Current Page Range**: Shows the range of visible items along with the total count (e.g., “1–5 of 10”).

![Enhanced Data Table Footer](/learn/assets/release-notes/datatable-pagination-enhancement-11-11-5.png)

To support this, two new options have been added in the **Advanced Settings** of the Data Table widget:

- **Show Page Size Selection**: Toggle to enable or disable the ability to select page size.
- **Page Size Options**: Allows custom comma-separated values (e.g., 3,7,10,20) to define the dropdown options for items per page.

![Studio Config - Page Size Options](/learn/assets/release-notes/datatable-pagination-enhancement-studio-11-11-5.png)

By default, the page size options are set to: 5,10,20,50,100.

This enhancement is supported in the following widgets:
1. Data Table
2. Cards
3. List

</details>

<details>
<summary>Custom ESLint configuration support added to Inspection Framework</summary>

The Inspection Framework now supports **custom ESLint configurations** via uploaded files, giving greater flexibility in enforcing coding standards.

#### How to Use

- Upload your custom ESLint configuration file named **`eslintrc-override.js`** to:
`src/main/webapp/resources/files`

- The file must export a valid ESLint config object using `module.exports`.

Example :
```js
const config = {
   env: {
       // e.g., browser: true, node: true
   },
   extends: [
       // e.g., "eslint:recommended"
   ],
   parserOptions: {
       // e.g., ecmaVersion: 2021
   },
   plugins: [
       // e.g., "regex"
   ],
   globals: {
       // e.g., jQuery: "readonly"
   },
   rules: {
       // e.g., "no-unused-vars": "warn"
   },
   overrides: [
       // Optional file-specific configurations
   ]
};

module.exports = config;
```
The uploaded `eslintrc-override.js` file will be merged with the WaveMaker’s default ESLint configuration. The Issues tab will reflect results based on this combined configuration.

Two copies of the combined configuration will copied to the `generated-angular-app` at below below locations:

1) `generated-angular-app/.eslintrc.js`

2) `generated-angular-app/resources/files/eslintrc-override.js`

The file at first location will be hidden in the studio file workspace.

#### Plugin Dependencies
If your ESLint config uses custom plugins, upload an `package-override.json` to the same path:
`src/main/webapp/resources/files`

Example :

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "eslint-plugin-regex": "1.10.0"
  }
}
```
This file will automatically be merged into the project’s default `package.json` to ensure the required plugins are installed.

<details>
<summary>Added "Read Only" option for Form widget</summary>

A new **Read Only** property has been added to the **Form** widget. When enabled, it:

- Makes all form fields read-only
- Disables all action buttons within the form

This feature is useful for scenarios where the form should be displayed in a non-editable mode for review or approval flows.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Improved AM/PM selection in Time and DateTime widgets</summary>

The **Time** and **DateTime** widgets now support a more intuitive AM/PM selection experience.

By default, A single toggle button was used to switch between **AM** and **PM**, as shown below.

![Default AM/PM Selection](/learn/assets/release-notes/am-pm-before-11-11-5.png)

To make it more intutive we have introduced a new property: **`Show AM/PM Buttons`**.
When enabled, the widget will display **two distinct buttons** — one for **AM** and one for **PM**. Selecting one automatically deselects the other, making the selection process easier to understand and use.

![New AM/PM Selection](/learn/assets/release-notes/am-pm-after-11-11-5.png)

By default, `Show AM/PM Buttons` is **disabled** to preserve existing behavior.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Added support to show custom labels in Slider widget</summary>

The **Slider** widget now supports displaying **custom labels** instead of only numeric values. This is useful for scenarios where predefined labels are more meaningful than numbers.

It also introduces **customizable label positioning**, allowing you to display labels either **above or below** the slider.

![Slider Widget with Labels](/learn/assets/release-notes/slider-label-11-11-5.jpg)

Two new properties have been added:

- **Showmarkers**: When enabled, displays labels instead of numbers along the slider.
- **Marker Text**: Accepts custom labels.

![Slider Widget with Labels Config](/learn/assets/release-notes/slider-config-11-11-5.png)

> Note: The length of the Marker Text array must match the number of steps in the slider.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Added support for sorting on custom columns in Data Table</summary>

Enhanced the **Data Table** widget to support sorting on **custom fields**.

A new **Sort By** field has been added to the widget’s advanced settings. 
![Sort By Config](/learn/assets/release-notes/sortBy-studio-11-11-5.png)

When configured, clicking on a custom column will sort the data based on the `Sort By` field value.

Example : Here data is sorted in descending order as per `Sort By` field value of the custom column.

![Sort By Example](/learn/assets/release-notes/sortBy-de-11-11-5.png)

Clinking on it again, will toggle soting order from descending to ascending.

![Sort By Example](/learn/assets/release-notes/sortBy-as-11-11-5.png)

</details>

<details>
<summary>Added hover hints and accessibility labels for row selection in Data Table</summary>

A new **hint** feature has been added to improve usability when selecting rows in the Data Table widget. When **Multiselect** or **Radio Column** row selection is enabled, users will now see a tooltip-style hint when hovering over the checkbox or radio button for each row.

![Checkbox Hint](/learn/assets/release-notes/checkbox-hint-11-11-5.png)

To support this, four new properties have been introduced under **Advanced Settings** of the Data Table:

- If **Multiselect** is enabled:
  - **Multiselect Hint**: Text shown on hover.
  - **Multiselect Aria-label**: Accessibility label for screen readers.

- If **Radio Column** is enabled:
  - **Radio Column Hint**: Text shown on hover.
  - **Radio Column Aria-label**: Accessibility label for screen readers.

![Checkbox Hint Config](/learn/assets/release-notes/checkbox-hint-config-11-11-5.png)

</details>

### Studio

<details>
<summary>Added "None" option to Base Path in REST API configuration</summary>

Enhanced the **REST API configuration** by introducing a **"None"** option in the **Base Path** dropdown. 

This allows users to configure an API **without** automatically prefixing it with any predefined base path, offering greater flexibility.
![Rest API](/learn/assets/release-notes/rest-api-11-11-5.png)

</details>

### React Native

<details>
<summary>Added "Stop at Last" option to control looping in Carousel widget</summary>

A new property **`stopatlast`** has been added to the **Carousel** widget. When enabled, the carousel **stops at the last slide** instead of looping back to the first one.

By default, this property is disabled.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Added support to show custom labels in Slider widget</summary>

The **Slider** widget now supports displaying **custom labels** instead of only numeric values. This is useful for scenarios where predefined labels are more meaningful than numbers.

It also introduces **customizable label positioning**, allowing you to display labels either **above or below** the slider.

![Slider Widget with Labels](/learn/assets/release-notes/slider-label-11-11-5.jpg)

A new property have been added:

- **Marker Text**: Accepts custom labels.
---
`Showmarkers` must be enabled to displays labels instead of numbers along the slider.

> Note: The length of the Marker Text array must match the number of steps in the slider.

</details>

<details>
<summary>

Added `onDeselect` callback support to List widget

</summary>

**`onDeselect`** callback event has been added to the **List widget** in Studio. This callback is triggered whenever an item in the list is **deselected**, allowing developers to handle custom logic during item deselection.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Added flag to control theme color inheritance in Lottie being used as loader</summary>

By default, when a **Lottie animation** is used as loader in app, it inherits **shades of primary color** from the app’s theme.

A new flag **`inheritThemePrimary`** has been introduced to customize this behavior. To **disable** theme-based color inheritance, set the following in `wm_rn_config.json`:

```json
"preferences": {
  "appLoader": {
    "inheritThemePrimary": false
  }
}
```
This gives developers greater control over the appearance of the Lottie being used as loader.

</details>

## Bugs

### Web

<details>
<summary>Fixed issue with page cache not working as expected</summary>

Resolved a bug where enabling the **cache** property for a page did not retain the page instance during navigation. The caching behavior now works correctly.
</details>

### React Native

<details>
<summary>Fixed incorrect display of "No Data Found" message during initial load in List widget</summary>

The **List widget** showed a "No Data Found" message **while data was still loading**, which could be confusing to users. This has been corrected.

Now, a **loading animation** is shown during the initial data fetch, and the **"No Data Found"** message appears **only if** no data is returned after loading completes.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Fixed extra space above Donut chart when Title and Sub Heading are empty</summary>

Resolved an issue where the **Donut chart** reserved vertical space for the Title and Sub Heading even when they were empty, resulting in unwanted spacing above the chart.

Now, if both `title` and `subheading` are not set, no extra space is added above the chart.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Fixed issue where dynamic form UI was not updating on data change</summary>

Resolved an issue where the **dynamic Form widget** UI was not reflecting changes when its underlying data was updated, especially when used inside widgets like **List** or **Accordion**.

The form now re-renders correctly to reflect the latest data.
</details>

<details>
<summary>

Fixed `selectItem` and `deselectItem` methods in List widget

</summary>

Resolved an issue where the **`selectItem()`** and **`deselectItem()`** methods on the **List widget** were not functioning as expected. These methods now work correctly.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Fixed issue where language did not update after changing locale in Select Locale widget in Web Preview</summary>

</details>

<details>
<summary>Fixed RTL layout issues in Toggle and Progress Bar widgets</summary>

Resolved layout and animation issues when the app is using a **Right-to-Left (RTL)** language:

- **Toggle Widget**: Fixed incorrect animation direction in RTL mode.
- **Progress Bar Widget**: Fixed layout misalignment when rendered in RTL mode.

Both widgets now render and behave correctly in RTL layouts.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Fixed app crash on tapping unbound Chart widget</summary>

Resolved an issue where tapping a **Chart widget** without any bound data would cause the app to crash.  
The widget now handles unbound states gracefully without triggering errors.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Fixed marker alignment issue in Slider widget</summary>

When `Showmarkers` was enabled in the **Slider** widget, the first and last markers were partially rendered outside the widget boundaries.  
This issue has been fixed, all markers now appear correctly within the slider area.
</details>

<details>
<summary>

Fixed border-radius issue on `wm-page-content`
</summary>

Resolved an issue where applying `border-radius` styles to `wm-page-content` using `.app-page-content` class had no effect.
