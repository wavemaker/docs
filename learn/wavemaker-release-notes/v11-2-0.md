## New Features and Improvements
---

### Cordova Android upgrade

Upgraded Cordova-Android to 11.0.0. WaveMaker platform migration will do the following changes in Cordova projects.

- default target Android SDK is to 32.
- In cordova-android 11.0.0, way of configuring splashscreen got changed. For more information, [check here](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/core/features/splashscreen/index.html#android-specific-information). Instead of full splash image, an icon with transparent background is enough. Background color of the splash can also be specified. For existing projects, WaveMaker Icon is set. Change it with app specific icon (288 X 288).
- Splashscreen plugin is no longer required and is removed.

### Bug Fixes

- In apk, REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES was added for auto update of apk during development. Later, auto upgrade functionality was deprecated. But, this permission is still present in config.xml. Recently, Google Playstore is seeking explanation from developer about the purpose. So, this permission is removed from config.xml.
