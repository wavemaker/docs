In this documentation, we will see how to format text within Label widgets using bold text and clickable links. The Label widget provides built-in text formatting functionality that supports markdown-style syntax - use `**double asterisks**` to make text bold and `[text](URL)` to create clickable links. This allows you to create rich text displays with emphasized content and interactive elements without requiring additional styling or custom components.

## Bold Text Formatting

<wm-label caption="A one-time code was sent to **john@gmail.com**. Please enter your code. For help, visit our **[support page](https://support.example.com)**." name="label" width="100%"></wm-label>
```
