App Logo is used in multiple places, for example:

- on the header of each page
- on the login page

[![design_logo](/learn/assets/design_logo.png)](/learn/assets/design_logo.png) 

## Steps to change app logo

By default WaveMaker logo is used as app logo. You can change it by replacing the logo file.

1. From the Main Menu, under **Import -> Resource** option locate the **logo** under the images folder. 

[![design_logo_resource](/learn/assets/design_logo_resource.png)](/learn/assets/design_logo_resource.png) 

2. Delete this file and upload the icon of your choice at the **same location with the same name**.
3. Run the app and see the change.
