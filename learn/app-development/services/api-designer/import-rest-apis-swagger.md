WaveMaker automatically generates UI functionality for create, read, update, delete (CRUD) operations if you import REST API endpoints via Swagger/OpenAPI. Most of the backend frameworks like Spring Boot, .NET core already support an automatic generation of Swagger documentation for the REST APIs. 

You can develop a WaveMaker app by importing REST APIs that have Swagger/OpenAPI support. Import REST services via Swagger to get access to the required information to consume and integrate with your app.

### Supported Widgets

**Web**: DataTable, Form, Cards (read-only), List (read-only).

**Mobile**: List with Form.

## Importing Swagger

Go to **APIs** section, and select **Imported APIs**.

Import Swagger from a URL or a File.

- **File**: Supports `.json`  
- **URL**: The service URL that hosts the REST service.  

For example, see [Swagger Petstore Project](http://petstore.swagger.io/).  
`https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json`

### Entity and Endpoints

When you import an API, all endpoints group into Entities. 
An Entity contains multiple endpoints. For example, CRUD endpoints, including Create, Read, Update, and Delete methods group into a single entity.

|HTML Verb |CRUD | Swagger |
|---|---|---|
|POST|Create |CREATE|
|GET|Read| LIST|
|PUT |Update |UPDATE|
|DELETE|Delete|DELETE|

From the left navigation, view all the identified **Entities**. Click the Entity name to see its endpoints, which categorize as **CRUD endpoints** and **Other endpoints**. You can modify these if needed.

:::note
If you cannot find an entity for a path, look for the **Others** entry from the **Entities** list. You can use them as a Variable; however, it does not support CRUD operations.

After verifying the details in the **Import APIs** dialog, click **Import** to add the service.

## Configuring Authentication

Next, in the following dialog configure, API authentication. Swagger supports OAuth 2.0. Click **OAuth Provider** to enter provider details.

In **OAuth Provider Configuration** dialog, enter the values for **Access Token URL**, **Client ID** and **Client Secret** of the imported REST service. To know how to configure these properties, see [OAuth Provider Configuration for REST Services](/learn/app-development/services/web-services/oauth-2-0-rest-services#oauth-provider-configuration).

For more information, see [REST Services using OAuth 2.0](/learn/app-development/services/web-services/oauth-2-0-rest-services), and see the list of Supported OAuth 2.0 Providers, [here](/learn/app-development/services/web-services/oauth-2-0-rest-services#supported-oauth-20-providers).

## Consuming Imported REST Services

When you successfully import a REST service, you can drag-and-drop the [supported](#supported-widgets) widgets to configure for CRUD-ready operations. To learn how to create a CRUD variable, see [Creating a CRUD Variable for REST Services](/learn/app-development/variables/crud-variable). 

Also, you can create a service variable, and integrate it with widgets to perform one operation at once using a single endpoint. For more information, see [Service Variable](/learn/app-development/variables/web-service).
