In WaveMaker, you can create an independent backend service which can be used multiple times across your app.

A backend service can be of any type. It can be a data service, web service, java service, security service, or using a third party API. Or, even extending a feature with your own code. 

Thus, you can consider external data as a service. Based on the underlying data, you can categorize backend services as _Web Services_, _Database Services_, _Java Services_ and _Security Services_. Each service is converted to a RESTful service and is consumed through their respective REST APIs.

## REST APIs

Services integrated into your app is converted to a RESTful service and are consumed through their respective REST APIs. These REST APIs are exposed via the [API Designer](/learn/app-development/services/api-designer/api#api-designer) and can be re-configured as per the application needs.
