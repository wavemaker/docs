Enterprise marketplace allows artifacts to be published by teams to be used across multiple teams. WaveMaker already has the feature to publish artifacts within the team where the members of the team can share and use the published artifacts. Now, with this feature teams will be able to share any artifact over marketplace and improve collaboration, reusability, while using new or existing Prefabs.

:::note
Enterprise Marketplace is available only with WaveMaker Enterprise version of the product and not available on wavemakeronline.com

:::note
Versioning of the Prefabs follow semantic versioning scheme.
:::

### Semantic Versioning

WaveMaker supports versioning system to name the releases. Semantic versioning is a globally accepted versioning scheme that is already followed by many software publishers. 

:::note
With WaveMaker 11.3, the support extends to follow semantic versioning for Artifacts, including Prefabs.
:::

An example of semantic versioning is as shown below.

![Semantic Versioning](/learn/assets/wm_semanticversion.png)

**Example**:

In a timeline of three months, the following versions can be published:

- Major  - **1**.0.0 , **2**.0.0, **3**.0.0
- Minor - 1.**1**.0, 2.**1**.0, 3.**1**.0
- Patch - 1.0.**1**, 1.0.**2**, 1.0.**3**, 2.0.**1**, 2.0.**2**

### Full Semantic Version Support for Prefabs Publishing

We've now extended this support to include pre-release and build details from [release 11.7.1](/learn/wavemaker-release-notes/v11-7-1).

For example, a version might look like **`1.2.1-beta+1234`**, where:

- `1`: Major version
- `2`: Minor version
- `1`: Patch version
- `-beta`: Pre-release identifier (lowercase hyphen followed by a pre-release label)
- `+1234`: Build metadata (optional identifier prefixed with a plus sign)

Developers can consume Prefab from WaveMaker Studio.
