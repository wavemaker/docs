## Introduction

In the Design module, you will learn how to create pages, use widgets, and apply styles for developing an app.

### How it works

WaveMaker app is a collection of pages. Pages load asynchronously on demand. Each page is composed of different UI elements and [widgets](/learn/app-development/widgets/widget-library). These UI elements enable user interaction and get data from the backend services. You can set navigation and interaction rules across pages.
