## Docker Upgrade


- Docker upgrade is required when you have docker version below 24.0.6 .
- User needs to upgrade docker if ssh-user doesn't have root/sudo privileges in Ubuntu OS StudioWorkspaceInstance/AppDeploymentInstance and if ssh-user have or doesn't have root/sudo privileges in RHEL OS StudioWorkspaceInstance/AppDeploymentInstance.
- Make sure Hibernate and passivate user containers and application containers from launchpad. 

- So follow the steps below when you added StudioWorkspaceInstance/AppDeploymentInstance.

### Docker Upgrade in Ubuntu

- Stop the current Docker.

```bash
  service docker.socket stop
  service docker stop
```

- Update the apt package index and install packages to allow apt to use a repository over HTTPS:

```bash 
     sudo apt-get update
     sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release
```    

- Add Dockerâ€™s official GPG key:

```bash 
     sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
    curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
```

- Use the following command to set up the repository:

```bash 
  echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
```  

- To upgrade and install the latest version of Docker, run the following command to list all the available versions:

  ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    apt-cache madison docker-ce
    apt-cache madison docker-ce-cli
  ```

- Run the following command to install a specific version of Docker.

  ```bash
    sudo apt-get install docker-ce=<VERSION_STRING> docker-ce-cli=<VERSION_STRING> containerd.io
    example: sudo apt-get install docker-ce=5:24.0.6-1~ubuntu.20.04~focal docker-ce-cli=5:24.0.6-1~ubuntu.20.04~focal containerd.io -y
  ```

- Example in ubuntu 22.x

  ```bash
    example: sudo apt-get install docker-ce=5:24.0.6-1~ubuntu.22.04~jammy docker-ce-cli=5:24.0.6-1~ubuntu.22.04~jammy containerd.io -y
  ``` 

#### Upgrade Docker using WaveMaker Script

- To Upgrade Docker to the latest version, the user need to use their own approach or WaveMaker provides a script to install.

  - Run the following command to install the Docker.

    ```bash 
        sudo bash wme-utility.sh --docker-upgrade 
    ```
    
- If the given platform user does not have privileged access, then provide the below permissions for the given user on StudioWorkspace Instance/AppDeployment Instance.  
- The user should be able to execute the following commands as a privileged user:
  - Add user to the Docker group.  
  - Make the user an owner of the Docker systemd process.
  - Data directory should be owned by the user.
  - Permission to manage Docker, service, systemctl daemon-reload, iptable.

  ```bash
      usermod -aG docker <user>
      mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/
      chown -R <user>:<user> /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d
      chown -R <user>:<user> /data
      echo "%<user> ALL=NOPASSWD: /bin/systemctl restart docker,/bin/systemctl daemon-reload,/sbin/iptables" >> /etc/sudoers.d/<sudoers-file-name>
  ```

### Docker Upgrade in RHEL

:::note

- You can choose to install Docker in any other way as per your company policy.
- Above commands depict one of them.
- Make sure to do the activities below after the Docker installation.
:::

- If the given platform user doesn't have privileged access, then provide the below permissions for the given user on StudioWorkspace Instance / AppDeployment Instance.
- The user should be able to execute the following commands as a privileged user:
  - Add user to the Docker group.  
  - Make the user an owner of the Docker system process.
  - Data directory should be owned by the user.
  - Permission to manage Docker, service, systemctl daemon-reload, iptable.

  ```bash
      usermod -aG docker <user>
      chown -R <user>:<user> /usr/lib/systemd/system
      chown -R <user>:<user> /data
      echo "%<user> ALL=NOPASSWD: /bin/systemctl restart docker,/bin/systemctl daemon-reload,/usr/sbin/iptables" >> /etc/sudoers.d/<sudoers-file-name>
  ```


### Make sure to Run below command after installation of docker completes to have WaveMaker docker configuration to your installed docker

- For Ubuntu

  ```bash 
      bash docker_configure.sh
  ```

- For RHEL

  ```bash
      bash docker_setup_rhel.sh
  ```

:::note 
  Excute the above configuration files only after giving the permissions if it in the case of non-root execution., which the steps are given in the next page.

### Studio Workspace/AppDeploy Instances Sync and Patch using Launchpad

- You can also apply the Sync or Patch using the Launchpad. To Apply, go to the Launchpad and Navigate to the Developer Workspace or App Deployements.
- On the Capacity, you can see the Workspace/AppDeploy Instance details. On the Icons Shown, you can find the patch and the sync option.

  [![Sync_and_patch](/learn/assets/wme-setup/upgrade-wme-setup/Sync-and-Patch.png)](/learn/assets/wme-setup/upgrade-wme-setup/Sync-and-Patch.png)

#### Go to Launchpad and see Instance status. You can start working on WaveMaker Studio once the Instances status has started.
