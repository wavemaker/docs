## Passivate containers in StudioWorkspace/AppDeployment Instances from the launchpad

- In order to upgrade WME from 10.x to below 11.2.x version, it is recommended to passivate the containers in StudioWorkspaceInstance and AppDeploymentInstance.., It is not needed when upgrading above 11.2.x versions.

- Following are the steps to passivate the containers before running patch.
 
  - After logging into launchpad in your WME setup go to the Developer Workspace Tab, and then go to the container as shown in the below image

  - Select the containers that are running, hibernate those containers one after the other by hitting the stop button as shown in the image below.
