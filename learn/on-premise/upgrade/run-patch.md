## Running the Patch

- When upgrading from 10.7.x to 11.x.x user needs to download the required content for the migration process.

::: note
When the user has already upgraded the WME setup to WME 11.x.x Version, in that case, there is no need to download the migration tar
:::    

- To download migration tar which will be shared by the WaveMaker team, please run the following command.

```bash
    wget <WME-Migration-Link>
```

- Extract wme_migrations to /usr/local/content/wme/wme-installer/< version>/resources folder, for extract the content run the following command

```bash
    sudo tar xvf wme_migrations.tar -C /usr/local/content/wme/wme-installer/<version>/resources/
 ```

- Run the bash script for upgrading to the desired version.
```shell
    bash /usr/local/content/wme/wme-installer/<version>/wme-installer.sh
```

- To make https work, You need to add SSL certificates to Platform or router/dns level while configuring the setup using ConfigWizard after the Ugrade process completes in terminal, to add SSL certificates please refer [ssl configuration for platform](/learn/on-premise/configure/config-ssl).

```
