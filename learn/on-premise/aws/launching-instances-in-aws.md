## Prerequisites

- AWS account with access for Launch Instances and to create a security groups.
- Reference for creating infrastructure in AWS visit [AWS documentation for creating EC2 linux instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html).
- Users need IAM policies and user permissions to view and work with create and manage EC2 instances and security groups in a specified VPC resource in the Amazon EC2 console.
- For IAM permissions and details visit [AWS IAM policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_actions-resources-contextkeys.html).

## Creating Security Groups

- Creating security group user need vpc ,if don't have a vpc ,for creating vpc refer [AWS documentation for creating vpc](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/gsg_create_vpc.html).
- Creating the security groups refer [AWS documentation for creating security groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/gsg_create_vpc.html).
- For WME setup require 3 security groups in AWS EC2. Those are,
  - [WME-SG-Platform-Public](#creation-of-wme-sg-platform-public-security-group)  
  - [WME-SG-Platform-Internal](#creating-wme-sg-platform-internal-security-group)
  - [WME-SG-Workspace-Internal](#creating-wme-sg-workspace-internal-security-group)
- Open the Amazon VPC console [vpc console amazon](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.) (or) under Networking & Content Delivery select Networking & Content Delivery select VPC.
- In the navigation pane, choose Security Groups, choose Create Security Group.

### Creation of WME-SG-Platform-Public Security Group

- Provide basic details for creating the security group and select your Desired VPC.

- Configure Security Group select existing security group and select WME-SG-Platform-Internal and after creation of instance select instance and at actions open networking section choose change security groups add security group WME-SG-Platform-Public.

[![security group](/learn/assets/wme-setup/wme-setup-in-aws/security-group-configurations.png)](/learn/assets/wme-setup/security-group-configurations.png)

- Next review your instance details and launch the instance.

## Launch External Instance (Studio Workspace Instance / AppDeployment Instance)

- Next review your instance details and launch the instance.

## Mounting storage volumes in EC2 Instances

### Mounting storage in Platform Instance

- Login into ec2 instance. For logging into EC2 instance open terminal use the below example command.

```bash
ssh -i path/to/accesskey.pem ubuntu@ipaddress
```

:::note
Accesskey will generate during creation of instance, at that time you have to select existing pem file or you can create new pem file for accessing the ec2 instance.
:::

- For mounting the storage refer [mounting storage volumes in AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-using-volumes.html).

- Check your list of block devices available by using the following command.

```bash
lsblk
```

- New volumes are raw block devices, and you must create a file system on them before you can mount and use them. For creating file systems use following command.

```bash
Command : mkfs -t ext4 /dev/<block-device-name_1>
          mkfs -t ext4 /dev/<block-device-name_2>
Example :
          mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdb
          mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdc
```

- Use the mkdir command to create a mount point directory for the volume. The mount point is where the volume is located in the file system tree and where you read and write files to after you mount the volume. for wme-setup create two directories. Create directories using the following commands.

```bash
mkdir /wm-data /wm-runtime
```

- Use the following command to mount the volume at the directory.

```bash
Command :  
          mount /dev/<block-device-name_1>    /wm-data
          mount /dev/<block-device-name_2>    /wm-runtime  
Example :
          mount /dev/xvdb    /wm-data
          mount /dev/xvdc    /wm-runtime  
```

[![mounting volumes](/learn/assets/wme-setup/wme-setup-in-aws/mounting-platform-instance-volumes.jpg)](/learn/assets/wme-setup/mounting-platform-instance-volumes.jpg)

- To mount an attached EBS volume on every system reboot, add an entry for the device to the /etc/fstab file.
- Take UUID of disks for identification by using the command.

```bash
blkid
```

- Entry the UUID of the disks in fstab.use the following format.

``` bash
UUID=<block-device_1-UUID>    /wm-data     ext4   defaults ,nofail  0  2
UUID=<block-device_2-UUID>    /wm-runtime  ext4   defaults ,nofail  0  2
```

### Mounting storage External Instance

:::note
Applies for StudioWorkspace Instance/AppDeployment Instance
:::

- Login into ec2 instance.for logging into EC2 instance open terminal use the below example command.

```bash
ssh -i path/to/accesskey.pem ubuntu@ipaddress
```

- Use the mkdir command to create a mount point directory for the volume. The mount point is where the volume is located in the file system tree and where you read and write files to after you mount the volume.for wme-setup create two directories.create directories using the following commands.

```bash
mkdir /data
```

- Use the following command to mount the volume at the directory.

```bash
Command : mount /dev/<block-device-name>   /data
Example : mount /dev/xvdb   /data  
```

- Take UUID of disks for identification by using the command.

```bash
blkid
```

- Entry the UUID of the disks in fstab.use the following format.

```bash
UUID=<your-block-device-UUID>    /data     ext4     defaults ,nofail  0  2
```

## What's next

- Install [prerequisites softwares](install-prerequisites.md) based on OS.
- Start WME Installation process
