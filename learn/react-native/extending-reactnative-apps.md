WaveMaker is a scalable accelerator platform that enables developers to rapidly build enterprise-grade applications with minimal coding while maintaining control over the generated code. Unlike other low-code platforms, WaveMaker allows developers to hyper-customise components and seamlessly extend functionality.

WaveMaker generates reusable Angular code that follows best practices, such as:

* **Component-Based Structure**: Each page is generated as an Angular component with an isolated scope.  
* **Security & Performance**: Auth guards, tree-shaking, and minification are applied to keep the code efficient and secure.  
* **Custom Extensions**: Developers can add custom or third-party Angular components to extend the generated ones.  
* **Easy Deployment**: The frontend code can be deployed separately as static assets to a CDN.

This document guides you on running, editing, and extending the generated Angular code for the web after detaching it from WaveMaker Studio. It also outlines our roadmap for improving this experience.

## **Running WaveMaker-Generated Code Locally**

### Steps to Run

1. Export the project as a ReactNative ZIP.  
2. Extract the downloaded ZIP file from WaveMaker Studio.  
3. Open the project in a code editor (e.g., VS Code).  
4. Navigate to the project directory:   
   **`cd generated-native-app`**  
5. Install dependencies:  
   **`npm install`**  
6. Run the application on expo:  
   **`npm run start`**

---

## **Editing & Customizing Generated ReactNative Code**

WaveMaker creates a standard project structure that allows developers to manage and extend the codebase independently. Understanding the file organization is key:

* **UI-related files:**  
   For a given page, files are typically located in `src/pages/PageName/` and include:

  * `PageName.component.js` – The UI component.  
  * `PageName.script.js` – Event handlers and business logic.  
  * `PageName.style.js` – Style definitions.  
  * `PageName.variables.js` – Definitions for variables (data, API calls, etc.).  
* **Global configurations:**

  * **Pages Configuration:**  
     The file `src/pages/pages.config.js` registers all pages/screens.  
  * **Navigation Actions:**  
     Global navigation actions are defined in `src/app.variables.js` (e.g., `goToPage_NewPage`).

### Modifying UI on an existing page

When updating a screen’s UI, you will typically:

* Edit the component file to change the layout or add new components.  
* Update the style file to adjust the look and feel.  
* Modify the script file to handle events or add custom logic.  
* Update the variables file to manage data bindings or API integrations.

Since it is generated by ReactNative code, developers have full freedom to either to use the components provided by [WaveMaker runtime](https://github.com/wavemaker/wavemaker-rn-runtime) (which is open-sourced) or use any other libraries like react-native-paper.

#### Working with WaveMaker Components

The generated React Native code leverages the `@wavemaker/app-rn-runtime` library to provide ready-to-use components. 

For example:

<img src={myImage1} alt="React Native Runtime data bindiing" style={{width:"600px"}}/>

* Data binding: WaveMaker uses an abstraction called *Variables* to hold metadata for API calls and data binding. 

For instance:

<!--![React Native Runtime data bindiing](/learn/assets/react-native/extentinding-reactnative-apps/image1.png)-->

<img src={myImage2} alt="React Native Runtime data bindiing" style={{width:"400px"}}/>



* Event binding: The same pattern of binding applies to events as well. But all the developers must write js methods that are referred, in corresponding {compoents}.script.js file


<img src={myImage3} alt="Script js writting syntax" style={{width:"600px"}}/>

#### 

#### Working with third-party Components

Since it is now a free react-native expo project, developers have the flexibility to easily add other react-native component libraries directly and work with them to take the development forward. For example: Below is a sample that shows how they can add react-native-paper components to existing pages and do data binding and event binding in a regular way.

**Installing a Library:**

`npm install react-naive-paper`

* **Using a Component:**  
   You can import and use components inside your page as needed:


<img src={myImage4} alt="React Native Runtime data bindiing" style={{width:"600px"}}/>


* **Limitations:** You cannot bind wavemaker variables and styles. 

#### 

### Creating a new page and working with APIs

Beyond working with existing pages, developers tend to face use cases where they need to create new pages and link them to existing flows/menus. Use new APIs to cater to these flows.

#### Working in WaveMaker way

Since developers understand WaveMaker page component structure, they can continue to create new pages and variables to work.

**New Page Creation:**

* Create a new folder in `src/pages` (e.g., `src/pages/WmNewPage`).  
* Add the following files with default templates:  
  * `WmNewPage.component.js`  
  * `WmNewPage.script.js`  
  * `WmNewPage.style.js`  
  * `WmNewPage.variables.js`

  **Update Configurations:**

* Edit `src/pages/pages.config.js` to register the new page.

<img src={myImage5} alt="React Native Runtime data bindiing" style={{width:"600px"}}/>

* Update `src/app.variables.js` to add a navigation action, for example

<img src={myImage6} alt="React Native Runtime data bindiing" style={{width:"600px"}}/>

* ##### New APIs

  In the same respective file structure for the relevant component add a new Variable object in variables.js file.

<img src={myImage7} alt="React Native Runtime data bindiing" style={{width:"600px"}}/>


#### Working in React-native way

**Single-File Page Creation:**

* Create a new file (e.g., `RnNewPage.js`) in the `src/pages/RnNewPage` folder.  
* Register the page in `src/pages/pages.config.js`.  
* Update `src/app.variables.js` with a corresponding navigation action.

**Limitations:**

* Although the page renders, it won’t have access to WaveMaker’s variable binding or custom components (like `WmLabel` or `WmButton`).

* ##### New APIs

  * Developers can directly use the fetch function to make API calls or can use any third-party library like Axios to make API calls

  <img src={myImage8} alt="React Native Runtime data bindiing" style={{width:"600px"}}/>


## **RoadMap**

We are working towards enhancing this experience. Especially when developers choose WaveMaker and libraries to maintain the code further. Below are a few plans we have got.

* Provide CLI for Page and Variable creation
