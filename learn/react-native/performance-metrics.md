## Performance Metrics

A performance metric is a measurable value that indicates the efficiency, effectiveness, quality, or performance of a 
process, system, or product. In the context of mobile applications, performance metrics help developers and managers 
understand how well the application is functioning and where improvements might be needed. 

Considering multiple metrics in performance measurement is pivotal to obtaining a holistic view of an application or 
systemâ€™s efficacy. Single metrics can offer a skewed perspective, potentially overlooking critical issues or 
opportunities for enhancement. By employing a diverse array of metrics, organizations ensure that all facets - from user
experience and system reliability to resource utilization and financial impact - are meticulously assessed. This 
multifaceted approach not only safeguards against performance blind spots but also fortifies decision-making, ensuring 
that strategies are formulated upon a comprehensive, nuanced understanding of performance dynamics.

We have identified categorized few important metrics that are essential for measuring the performance of a mobile 
application. The following are the categories of performance metrics:
