Flipper is a tool for debugging iOS, Android, and React Native apps to access applications from a desktop interface where you can visualize and inspect the code. WaveMaker has integrated Flipper using CLI **`wm-reactnative-cli`**.

## Steps to Setup

2. After installing Flipper, select the **Settings** option from the left menu.

5. Ensure that the requirements are met for each respective development environments. If the requirements fail or show warning, you can expand the item and address the issues and perform **re-run**.

## Debug 

1. Open the project and preview the application.

2. Copy the preview URL. For example:

```
https://wavemakeronline.com/â€¦../{Project_Name}
```

For Android, run the following command.

```
wm-reactnative run android "preview-link" --clean
```

For iOS, run the following command.

```
wm-reactnative run ios "preview-link" --clean
```

:::note
You can skip the `clean` option after the initial run.

## Flipper Default Plugins

For React Native applications, you can use some plugins by default, including Crash Reporter, Logs, React DevTools, and Network.

### Crash Reporter

The Crash Reporter plugin shows a notification in Flipper when the app crashes. The notification shows the crash information, such as stacktrace and other metadata.

### Logs

The Logs plugin shows device logs without any additional setup. There are plugins for both Device and App Logs.

### React DevTools

The React DevTools shows the React Native Component Tree, which can be used to edit the component properties.

:::note
Run the following command if Flipper fails to connect to the device.

`adb reverse tcp:8097 tcp:8097`

### Network

The Network plugin provides the Network Inspector, which is used to inspect outgoing network traffic in your apps. You can easily browse all requests being made and their responses. The plugin also supports gzipped responses.
