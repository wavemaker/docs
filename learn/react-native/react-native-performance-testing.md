## Performance Testing Strategy for WaveMaker Applications

To ensure a smooth and responsive user experience, performance testing is conducted on WaveMaker mobile applications. This involves measuring app behavior under varying load conditions, analyzing response times, resource utilization (CPU, memory, network), and identifying potential performance bottlenecks. Both manual and automated approaches are used across real devices and emulators to validate app performance under real-world scenarios.

### Key Activities:
- Monitor **app launch time** and **screen transition delays**.
- Evaluate performance on both **emulators/simulators** and **real devices**.
- Use **profiling tools** to track performance metrics such as CPU, memory, and network usage.
- Validate stability and responsiveness under different load conditions.

### Tools Used:
- **BrowserStack Performance Metrics** – To assess runtime performance across a wide range of real devices.
- **Apptim** – For detailed performance profiling, including app load times, memory usage, and CPU consumption.

### Key Performance Metrics that are tracked

Among various metrics, these are the most critical ones we track,

- App Launch Time
- Time to Interactive (TTI)
- Frame Rate Stability
- Screen Load Time
- UI Jank (Dropped Frames)
- Memory Leaks Detection
- CPU Utilization
- Memory Consumption
- Application Size
