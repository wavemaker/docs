To ensure consistent functionality and user experience across a diverse device ecosystem, device compatibility testing is a crucial part of our testing strategy. WaveMaker mobile applications are tested on a wide range of Android and iOS devices with varying screen sizes, resolutions, and operating system versions. This helps identify UI misalignments, functional inconsistencies, and OS-specific issues early in the development cycle.

### Key Objectives

- Validate UI/UX consistency across different screen dimensions (phones, tablets, etc.).
- Ensure compatibility with both the latest and legacy OS versions.
- Identify platform-specific behavior or rendering issues.
- Confirm smooth app performance on low-end, mid-range, and high-end devices like
