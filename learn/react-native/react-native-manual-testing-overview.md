To ensure app quality, stability, and usability across iOS and Android platforms, we thoroughly validate all key testing modules, including Functional, UI/UX, Performance, Accessibility, and more.

### Scope of Testing

- **UI/UX Testing**: To ensure the app is visually appealing and provides a smooth, intuitive user experience.  
- **Functional Testing**: To verify that all features work as intended and meet specified requirements.
- **Platform Compatibility (iOS/Android)**: To ensure the app performs consistently across different mobile operating systems.  
- **Device Compatibility (Various Screen Sizes, OS Versions)**: To confirm the app adapts correctly to different screen sizes and OS versions.  
- **Performance Testing**: To assess the app’s speed, responsiveness, and stability under various conditions.  
- **Accessibility Testing**: To make sure the app is usable by people with disabilities, meeting accessibility standards.

### Testing Approach

Manual test cases are executed for:

- **New Features and Modules**: To ensure new functionalities work correctly and don’t break existing systems.
- **Bug Fixes and UI Updates**: To confirm that reported issues are resolved and visual changes behave as expected.
- **Widget-level Changes**: To validate that individual components function properly in isolation and within the UI.
- **Integration Testing**: To ensure different services and components (e.g., security, REST APIs, databases) work together seamlessly.
- **Regression Testing**: To detect if recent changes have unintentionally affected existing functionality.
- **Sanity Testing**: To quickly verify that the basic functionality of the application is working after a build or minor change.

### Testing Conducted On

- Real devices
- Emulators
- Cloud-based platforms like BrowserStack
